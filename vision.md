# Vision: New River Gorge 2026

> Rain-contingency alternative to the [Chattanooga 2026](https://github.com/sdeery14/chattanooga-2026) bouldering trip.
> Same format, different rock.

## Why This Plan Exists

The Chattanooga trip (Feb 14-21, 2026) is built around southeastern sandstone bouldering -- Stone Fort, Rocktown, HP40. Those areas are weather-fragile: sustained rain turns approaches to mud, seeps take days to dry, and friction vanishes on wet sandstone slabs. If the forecast goes south, we need a plan B that isn't "sit in the Airbnb and drink."

**New River Gorge is that plan B.**

While NRG is best known for its sport and trad routes, the broader New River Gorge region has legitimate bouldering -- scattered Nuttall sandstone boulders in the gorge, developed areas near Summersville Lake, Meadow River, and surrounding zones. The rock is steep, featured, and in many cases sheltered by the gorge walls and forest canopy. Combined with hiking, mountain biking, and Fayetteville's small-town climbing scene, it's a viable week of bouldering with better foul-weather options than the Tennessee/Georgia/Alabama circuit.

## Trip Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Dates** | February 14-21, 2026 (Saturday to Saturday) |
| **Location** | New River Gorge area, West Virginia |
| **Base town** | Fayetteville, WV (most likely) |
| **Group size** | 5-6 climbers (see roster notes below) |
| **Trigger** | Chattanooga forecast shows 3+ consecutive rain days in the week prior |

---

## The Group

Five to six climbers across three ability bands. Two members may attend only half the trip -- one joining for the first half, the other for the second -- so the group composition shifts mid-week.

| Band | Count | Grade Range | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Hard** | 2 | ~V10 | Trip anchors. Area selection prioritizes quality hard lines for this pair. |
| **Intermediate** | 2 | ~V6 | Solid climbers who can project in the V5-V7 range and warm up on moderate classics. |
| **Beginner** | 1-2 | V1-V3 | Newer climbers. Need areas with good density of easy-to-moderate problems. |

### Half-Trip Members

Two people may split the week:
- **First-half member**: Arrives Saturday (Feb 14), departs mid-week (~Wednesday Feb 18)
- **Second-half member**: Arrives mid-week (~Wednesday Feb 18), departs Saturday (Feb 21)

This affects logistics (lodging headcount, car capacity, carpooling) and daily planning (group dynamics shift at the midpoint). Docs should flag where this matters.

## Scope

### What's In Scope

- **Bouldering** -- 100% of climbing activity. NRG-area bouldering: Meadow River, Summersville Lake, gorge boulders, and any other developed or developing areas within reasonable driving distance of Fayetteville.
- **Mountain biking** -- First-class activity, same as Chattanooga. Arrowhead Trails and other systems near Fayetteville.
- **Hiking & sightseeing** -- Long Point Trail, Endless Wall Trail, the NRG Bridge, Grandview, etc.
- **Rest-day activities** -- Fayetteville restaurants, breweries, hot springs, indoor options.
- **Conditions & weather intelligence** -- NRG-specific: Nuttall sandstone behavior, seepage patterns, wind in the gorge, February temps, which boulder fields have natural shelter.

### What's Out of Scope

- **Sport climbing** -- Not part of this trip. NRG is famous for routes, but this group is here to boulder.
- **Trad climbing** -- No.
- **Whitewater rafting** -- February water temps make this a non-starter.
- **New River Gorge Bridge activities** -- Bridge Day is in October. The bridge walkway may have limited winter access.

## Guiding Principles

Carried forward from the Chattanooga plan, tuned for NRG:

### 1. Preparation Over Planning
Curate high-quality options, don't build a fixed itinerary. The group decides each morning based on weather, energy, and psych.

### 2. Optionality Is a Feature
Every climbing day should have a dry-weather plan AND a wet-weather plan. Surface which boulder fields have natural shelter, overhangs, or fast-drying rock.

### 3. Low-Friction Access
Documents must be skimmable, searchable, and usable on a phone at the crag. Quick-reference tables up top, details below.

### 4. Mixed-Ability Aware
Three distinct ability bands means area selection must work for everyone present. Every area profile should note whether it has problems across all three bands or skews toward a subset. Flag areas where beginners will run out of problems quickly or where hard climbers won't find enough to stay engaged.

### 5. Weather-Resilience First
This is a rain-contingency trip. Every area profile must include: Are there sheltered boulders? How fast does the rock dry after rain? What's the seepage situation? Wind exposure? This is the reason this trip exists instead of Chattanooga.

### 6. Roster-Shift Aware
The group changes at mid-week. Docs should note where this matters -- lodging capacity, car logistics, and whether daily plans need to account for different ability-band ratios in the first vs. second half.

## Feature Roadmap

Features are sequenced so that each builds on the outputs of prior features. Same Specify workflow as Chattanooga: specify -> clarify -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> checklist.

### Phase 1: Foundation

| # | Feature | Description | Depends On |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| 001 | **Primary Bouldering Areas** | Area profiles for every bouldering zone within reasonable range of Fayetteville. Hard-climbing priority with group-aware assessments. Rain resilience rating for each area. Shelter and drying characteristics. | -- |
| 002 | **Problem Clusters** | Curated problem lists per area by grade band: V0-V3, V4-V6, V7-V10. Highlight sheltered classics. Note style (slab, overhang, compression, etc.) and landing quality. | 001 |

### Phase 2: Activities & Conditions

| # | Feature | Description | Depends On |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| 003 | **Mountain Biking Trails** | Trail profiles for Arrowhead Trails, Babcock State Park, Summit Bechtel Reserve, and other rideable systems near Fayetteville. February conditions, difficulty ratings, climbing-area pairings. | 001 |
| 004 | **Conditions, Weather & Drying Guide** | Nuttall sandstone primer (friction, seepage, drying times). Per-area weather behavior. February seasonal data. Wind patterns in the gorge. The core reference for daily decision-making. | 001, 002 |
| 005 | **Rest-Day & Low-Energy Pack** | Fayetteville dining, breweries (Bridge Brew Works, Fayetteville Brewing), hot springs, hiking, indoor options. Energy-tiered like Chattanooga. | -- |

### Phase 3: Logistics & Personalization

| # | Feature | Description | Depends On |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| 006 | **Logistics & Access Cheat Sheets** | Drive times from base, parking, approach trails, access warnings. NPS regulations. Fee areas. Mid-week roster change logistics (lodging, cars). | 001, 003 |

## Key Differences from Chattanooga Plan

| Dimension | Chattanooga | New River Gorge |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Primary activity** | Bouldering | Bouldering |
| **Rock type** | Cumberland sandstone (varied) | Nuttall sandstone (steep, featured) |
| **Bouldering depth** | World-class (Stone Fort, Rocktown, HP40) | Developing -- fewer problems, less documentation |
| **Rain resilience** | Low -- most areas seep and stay wet | Potentially better -- gorge shelter, overhanging boulders |
| **Group size** | 5-6 (with mid-week roster change) | 5-6 (with mid-week roster change) |
| **Ability bands** | V1-V3 / V6 / V10 (2 per band) | V1-V3 / V6 / V10 (2 per band) |
| **Mountain biking** | Excellent (many trail systems) | Good (Arrowhead Trails + others) |
| **Base town vibe** | Chattanooga (mid-size city) | Fayetteville (small climbing town) |
| **National Park status** | No | Yes (NRG became a National Park in 2020) |

## Constitution Seeds

These will be formalized via `/speckit.constitution` once the first feature is underway:

1. **Decision-Support First** -- Every document serves rapid in-the-moment decisions.
2. **Bouldering Scope Boundary (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** -- 100% bouldering. No sport, trad, or route climbing.
3. **Ability-Aware, Hard-Climbing Priority** -- V10 objectives come first; V6 and V1-V3 problems noted where they exist.
4. **Mountain Biking as First-Class Activity** -- Equal research rigor to climbing.
5. **Weather-Resilience as Core Value** -- Rain behavior and shelter must be documented for every area. This is the reason the trip exists.
6. **Source Accuracy & Recency** -- Cite sources; flag unverified claims with `[UNVERIFIED]`.

## How to Use This Repo

This project uses the **Specify (Spec-Kit)** workflow, the same methodology used for the Chattanooga plan. Each feature follows the cycle:

```
/speckit.specify  ->  /speckit.clarify  ->  /speckit.plan  ->  /speckit.tasks  ->  /speckit.implement  ->  /speckit.checklist
```

To start the first feature:

1. Set up the repo structure (CLAUDE.md, .claude/commands/, .specify/, .gitignore)
2. Run `/speckit.specify` with Feature 001 (Primary Bouldering Areas)
3. Follow the workflow through to implementation
4. Repeat for each subsequent feature
