## Winter Access Warnings

> February-specific hazards with alternates for each location.

### Fayette Station Road (Bridge Buttress Access)

- **Hazard**: Narrow, winding road descends ~700 ft to gorge floor. NPS may close entirely in icy conditions. Black ice in shaded sections even when open. No guardrails in places. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Alternate**: Use Canyon Rim Visitor Center parking ([GPS](https://www.google.com/maps?q=38.0700,-81.0750) [UNVERIFIED]) and approach on foot (~0.5-0.7 mi [UNVERIFIED], longer but road is maintained and safer). Canyon Rim is on the main rim road, not the gorge descent.
- **Status check**: Call NPS (304) 574-2115 or check wv511.org morning-of.
- **Source**: NPS nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/fayette-station-road.htm [UNVERIFIED]

### Summersville Lake Gates

- **Hazard**: USACE access roads may be gated November through April. Long Point Trailhead is the most reliable year-round access, but gate status is not guaranteed. Trail to lakeshore can be muddy/icy. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Alternate**: If gated, no good alternate access to Summersville Lake bouldering. Choose a different area — [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) (30 min) or [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) (5-15 min).
- **Status check**: Call USACE (304) 872-3459 to confirm gate status before driving.

### Kaymoor Steps

- **Hazard**: 800+ steel grate steps descend 600-800 ft to the gorge floor. Steel grate is extremely slippery when wet, icy, or frosted. Microspikes provide poor traction on steel grate. Strenuous return ascent. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Alternate**: **Choose a different area.** No alternate approach to Kaymoor exists. Use [Gorge Boulders — Bridge Buttress](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) (5-15 min, much shorter approach) or [Endless Wall](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) (10 min) instead.
- **Status check**: Visual inspection only — if steps are wet or frosted, do not descend.

### Babcock State Park Interior Roads

- **Hazard**: Interior park roads may be gated or unplowed in February. Access to trailheads beyond the park entrance is not guaranteed in winter. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Alternate**: Park near the entrance and ride in on the road (adds distance to the ride). Or ride [Arrowhead Trails](../trails/arrowhead.md) instead (~5-10 min from town, paved access).
- **Status check**: Call Babcock (304) 438-3004 to confirm road access before driving.

### Summit Bechtel Reserve

- **Hazard**: Private BSA facility. Public mountain biking access is NOT guaranteed. Winter hours may be completely unavailable. Fees likely $5-20/day. Waiver and registration may be required. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Alternate**: Ride [Arrowhead Trails](../trails/arrowhead.md) instead — closest to town, free, no access restrictions.
- **Status check**: **MUST call (304) 465-2800 or check summitbsa.org BEFORE driving.** Do not show up without confirming access.

### Gorge Approaches — General

- **Hazard**: All gorge descents (Endless Wall, Bridge Buttress, Kaymoor) can have icy sections in winter, especially north-facing trails and wooden boardwalks. Mud at cliff base is common after rain/thaw.
- **Mitigation**: Carry microspikes on all gorge approaches in February. Allow extra time for careful descent and ascent.

## Car Strategy

> Generic templates — fill in actual names and car details before the trip.

### Fleet Overview

| Item | First Half (Sat–Wed) | Second Half (Wed–Sat) |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Group size | 6 | 5 → 6 (Arriving Member joins Wed PM) |
| Cars available | Car A, Car B (+ Car C if 3-car fleet) | Adjusted — see roster-change notes |
| Drivers | Driver A, Driver B (+ Driver C) | Adjusted per departure/arrival |
| Seats total | 10-15 (2-3 cars) | Depends on fleet change |

**Minimum viable fleet**: 2 cars. One car per active subgroup on split days. If only 1 car available, the full group must go to the same destination.

### Daily Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Full Group — Same Destination

Everyone goes to the same bouldering area.

| Car | Destination | Passengers | Departure |
|-----|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Car A | Bouldering area (e.g., Meadow River) | 3-4 members | ~8:00 AM |
| Car B | Same area | 2-3 members | ~8:00 AM (convoy) |

**Parking notes by destination**:
- Meadow River: Pulloffs fit 5-10 cars per spot — 2 cars OK, park at same pulloff or adjacent
- Summersville Lake: Long Point lot fits 10-15 cars — 2 cars no problem
- Gorge — Endless Wall: NPS lot fits 15-20 cars — 2 cars fine
- Gorge — Bridge Buttress: Fayette Station area is limited; if 2+ cars, use Canyon Rim Visitor Center
- Arrowhead Trails: Lot capacity unknown — arrive together to assess

#### Scenario 2: Split Day — Boulder + Bike

Group splits between bouldering and mountain biking.

| Car | Destination | Passengers | Departure |
|-----|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Car A | Bouldering area | 3-4 climbers | ~8:00 AM |
| Car B | Trail system (e.g., Arrowhead) | 2 riders | ~7:30 AM (ride early on frozen ground) |

**Coordination notes**:
- Riders depart earlier to catch frozen trail window (best before 10 AM)
- Climbers can start later (friction improves as it warms)
- If both groups finish mid-afternoon, rendezvous at the rental house or a Fayetteville restaurant
- If Arrowhead + Gorge Boulders: both are 5-15 min from town — easy mid-day car swap if needed

#### Scenario 3: Bad Weather — Town Day

Rain, ice, or group rest day. Minimal driving.

| Car | Destination | Passengers | Departure |
|-----|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Car A | Downtown Fayetteville (or stays at house) | All who want town | Walk or 5 min drive |
| Car B | Stays at house | — | — |

**Notes**:
- Downtown Fayetteville is walkable if the rental house is in town. Most restaurants, shops, and Water Stone Outdoors are within a few blocks.
- If the rental house is outside town (Lansing, Hico, US-19 corridor): one car gets everyone to downtown
- For indoor options beyond walking distance (bowling, cinema in Oak Hill), see [Rest-Day Guide](../rest-day/README.md)
- Gas up at Sheetz (24-hr, Whitewater Ave) if heading out later

## Roster-Change Day (Wednesday)

> One member departs morning. Another arrives afternoon. Here's the logistics plan.

**Situation**: Departing Member leaves Wednesday morning (~Feb 18). Arriving Member arrives Wednesday afternoon.

### Morning — Departure

- **Departing Member leaves**: ~8-9 AM Wednesday
- **Car handoff**:
  - *If Departing Member drove their own car*: They take it. Fleet drops by 1 car. Remaining group has 1-2 cars for the rest of the week.
  - *If Departing Member carpooled in (no car)*: No fleet change. They get a ride to the airport/departure point from a group member — plan a ~1.5 hr drive to CRW (Charleston).
- **Group activity**: Remaining 4-5 members can boulder, bike, or rest. Wednesday is a natural rest-day candidate — see [Rest-Day Guide → Roster-Change Day](../rest-day/README.md#roster-change-day-wednesday) for activity suggestions.

### Afternoon — Arrival

- **Arriving Member arrives**: Target ~2-4 PM Wednesday at airport
- **Recommended airport**: Yeager Airport, Charleston, WV (CRW) — see [Nearest Airports](#nearest-airports) below
- **Pickup plan**:
  - *Option 1 (Recommended)*: Arriving Member **rents a car at CRW**. Drive to Fayetteville (~1.5 hrs via US-19 S / I-77). This adds a car to the fleet for the rest of the week.
  - *Option 2*: Group member **picks up** Arriving Member at CRW. Round trip ~3 hours. This costs one group member their afternoon.
- **Drive to Fayetteville**: ~1 hr 25 min from CRW via I-77 N → US-19 N. Straightforward highway drive. US-19 is Priority 1 for plowing [UNVERIFIED].

### Evening — Full New Group

- **Lodging adjustment**: Departing Member's room/bed → Arriving Member. Communicate room assignment before arrival so they can settle in quickly.
- **Fleet update**: Depends on scenarios above. Best case: fleet stays same or increases by 1 (if Arriving Member rents). Worst case: fleet drops by 1 (Departing Member took a car, Arriving Member got picked up).
- **Welcome activity**: Group dinner at a Fayetteville restaurant. See [Rest-Day Guide → Dining](../rest-day/README.md#dining) for options. Recommendation: Cathedral Cafe or Pies & Pints — both are group-friendly and walkable from downtown.

### Flight Delay Contingency

If the Arriving Member's flight is delayed:
- The group continues with their day plan (don't lose the afternoon waiting)
- If Arriving Member rented a car: they drive to Fayetteville whenever they land — no group coordination needed
- If group pickup was planned: reschedule to evening. The group can have an early dinner in town while waiting
- Keep the rental house address and a local contact number in a shared note (cell service may be spotty)

| Raleigh County (Beckley, WV) | BKW | ~40 min | Contour only (CLT route) | Yes (3 agencies) | Closest but single airline/route — unreliable for scheduling |
| Roanoke-Blacksburg (VA) | ROA | ~2 hr 35 min | Allegiant, American, Delta, United | Yes | Backup — best airline diversity but long drive |

**Recommendation**: Fly into **CRW (Charleston)**. Most flight options, most rental car agencies, and a manageable 1.5-hour drive on well-maintained highways.
