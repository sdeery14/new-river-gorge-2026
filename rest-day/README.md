## Hot Springs & Spa

> **Honest assessment**: Hot springs options near Fayetteville are extremely limited. The only facility within 90 minutes is The Greenbrier — a luxury resort, not a casual soak. Berkeley Springs (4+ hrs) and the Omni Homestead in Virginia (5.5+ hrs) are too far for a rest day. If the group wants a "soak and relax" day, consider checking whether the rental house has a hot tub.

### The Greenbrier
- **Location**: White Sulphur Springs, WV (~1 hr 32 min / 62 miles from Fayetteville)
- **Cost**: $$$ — luxury resort pricing. Expect $150+ per person for spa treatments [UNVERIFIED]
- **Reservations**: Required [UNVERIFIED]
- **February Availability**: Year-round resort — likely open, but confirm before driving [UNVERIFIED]
- **What to Expect**: Historic mineral spa with natural healing waters. The signature "Greenbrier Treatment" includes a soak in the mineral waters, Swiss shower, scotch spray, and Swedish massage. This is a high-end experience — dress code may apply.
- **Notes**: This is a splurge option, not an everyday rest-day activity. Best for: a special occasion mid-trip, or if the group wants one memorable non-climbing experience. Budget ~4 hours minimum (1.5 hr drive each way + spa time).

## Roster-Change Day (Wednesday)

**Situation**: One member departs Wednesday morning (~Feb 18). Another member arrives Wednesday afternoon/evening (~Feb 18). The group is smaller during the day and reconvenes at full strength for dinner.

### Morning (smaller group, 4-5 people)

The departing member handles their own logistics. The remaining group has a lighter day:

- **Low-key morning**: Cathedral Cafe breakfast (8a), then Canyon Rim Boardwalk or Visitor Center — easy, close, no major commitment
- **Moderate morning**: Grandview area — combine Tunnel Trail + Grandview Rim Trail + Castle Rock for a half-day of easy scenic walking
- **Grocery restock**: Mid-week Walmart run if supplies are low — good time to restock before the second-half crew arrives

### Afternoon (transition window)

- Keep plans flexible — the new arrival's timing may shift
- **If time allows**: Thurmond Ghost Town is a good low-commitment afternoon trip that works with a changing schedule
- **Stay close**: Fayetteville town exploration — walk around, browse shops, grab coffee

### Evening (full new group, 5-6 people)

Welcome the new arrival with a group-friendly dinner:

- **Recommended**: Pies & Pints — group-friendly, casual, craft beer, no reservation needed. Easy for a first-night gathering.
- **Alternative**: OK Chinese Buffet in Oak Hill — massive capacity, zero wait, everyone finds something. Good if the arrival is late and nobody wants to deliberate.
- **If celebrating**: The Gaines Estate for a nicer sit-down dinner (reserve ahead).
