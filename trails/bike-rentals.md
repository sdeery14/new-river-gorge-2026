## Bring Your Own Bike

> **This is the most reliable February strategy.** No shop closures, no availability issues, no size limitations. If you own a mountain bike, bring it.

### Transport Options

- **Hitch-mount bike rack**: Most common for groups (2-4 bike capacity). Confirm rental car has a hitch receiver or bring an adapter.
- **Roof rack**: Works but adds vehicle height — watch clearance at gas stations and drive-throughs.
- **Inside the vehicle**: SUV or truck bed with front wheel removed. Most weather-protected option for February travel.
- **Trunk rack**: Budget option (2-3 bikes), less secure. Works for sedans and small SUVs.

### If Flying

- **Airline bike bags**: $35-75 each way as checked luggage [UNVERIFIED] — check your airline's oversized baggage policy
- **Bike shipping services**: BikeFlights, ShipBikes — ship to Fayetteville ahead of time [UNVERIFIED]
- **Rental car rack**: Confirm with your rental car agency whether racks are allowed/available. New River Bikes may rent car racks [UNVERIFIED].

### Advantages

- Guaranteed availability (no February closure risk)
- Ride your own properly-fitted bike
- No return deadlines or rental damage worries
- Can ride any day conditions allow without coordinating with a shop

## Beginner Rental Guidance

> New to mountain biking? Several group members are V1-V3 climbers who may ride instead of climb on some days. Here's what you need to know.

### What Kind of Bike to Ask For

**Ask for a hardtail mountain bike.** This is the right choice for beginners on NRG's green and blue trails.

- **Hardtail** (front suspension only): Lighter, cheaper to rent, and helps you learn to read the trail. Best for green/blue trails.
- **Full-suspension** (front + rear): More comfortable on rough terrain but higher cost. Nice upgrade if available, not necessary for beginner trails.
- **Do NOT rent**: Road bikes (no traction on dirt), hybrids (not built for off-road), or cruisers (too heavy, no suspension).

### What Size

Tell the shop your height — they'll fit you. This table gives you a starting point:

| Frame Size | Height Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| Small (S) | 5'0"–5'4" |
| Medium (M) | 5'4"–5'8" |
| Large (L) | 5'8"–6'0" |
| X-Large (XL) | 6'0"+ |

**Key point**: You need at least 1 inch of clearance when straddling the bike (standover height). The shop staff will adjust seat height and handlebar position for you. [UNVERIFIED — sizing varies by manufacturer]

### What Else Do You Need

**Typically included with rental**: Bike + helmet.

**Bring yourself**:
- **Gloves** — full-fingered, for grip, warmth, and fall protection
- **Appropriate shoes** — stiff-soled, flat-pedal compatible (hiking shoes work; NOT soft sneakers or sandals)
- **Layers** — see February clothing guide below
- **Water bottle** and trail snacks
- **Wool or synthetic socks** — not cotton (retains cold moisture)

**Optional but helpful**:
- Knee pads (good for confidence on unfamiliar trails)
- Small backpack for water and extra layers
- Sunglasses (wind protection on descents)

### February Riding Tips

**What to wear (30-45°F)**:
- **Base layer**: Long-sleeve wicking shirt (not cotton)
- **Mid layer**: Fleece or insulating jacket
- **Outer layer**: Windproof/water-resistant shell
- **Legs**: Tights or warm pants (jeans work in a pinch but aren't ideal)
- **Hands**: Full-fingered gloves (medium weight)
- **Head**: Beanie or headband that fits under helmet
- **Feet**: Wool socks; shoe covers optional but helpful

**Key principle**: You'll warm up fast while pedaling and cool down fast while coasting. Layers let you adjust mid-ride.

**When NOT to ride**:
- **Muddy trails** — if your tires leave ruts deeper than ~1 inch, turn around. Riding wet singletrack causes damage that lasts months. This is a community ethic.
- **Active rain** — trails become slippery and erode. Wait for dry conditions.
- **Icy trails** — if frozen sections aren't rideable, hike around or skip the ride.

**Freeze-thaw awareness**: Ground may be frozen at dawn (rideable) but turns to mud by midday (not rideable). The best window is early morning on cold, sunny days. Finish before the surface thaws. See the [Conditions Guide](../conditions/README.md) for daily weather decisions.

For trail difficulty and conditions, see the [Trail Profiles](README.md) — start with [Arrowhead Trails](arrowhead.md) (green/blue, closest to town, free).
