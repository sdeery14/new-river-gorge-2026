|--------|-------|
| Total mileage | ~5-10 mi [UNVERIFIED] |
| Difficulty range | 🟢 Green Circle — 🔵 Blue Square |
| Trail style | Old roads, railroad grades, doubletrack — NOT purpose-built MTB singletrack |

## February Conditions

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Freeze/thaw | Active at ~2,000-2,500 ft elevation — colder than Fayetteville, cycles likely daily |
| Mud risk | HIGH — old roads and railroad grades hold water and soften quickly during thaw |
| Ice risk | MODERATE-HIGH — higher elevation increases ice persistence, especially on shaded grades |
| Snow | More likely than Fayetteville valley; accumulation possible at elevation |
| Seasonal closures | Park land accessible year-round, but facilities (cabins, restaurant) closed seasonally. Interior park roads MAY be gated or unplowed in winter — call to verify [UNVERIFIED] |
| Hunting season | WV late seasons may extend into early-mid February — **blaze orange strongly advisable** |
| Best riding days | Afternoon rides after several dry days above freezing; avoid mornings during active freeze/thaw |
| Overall viability | LOW-MODERATE — Rideable on good days, but high mud/ice risk and uncertain winter road access make this a "check that morning" destination |

> **Check morning-of**: Call Babcock State Park at (304) 438-3004 [UNVERIFIED] to confirm road access and current conditions. Check wvstateparks.com for alerts.

> **Hunting season warning**: WV hunting seasons may extend into early-mid February. If riding during this period, wear blaze orange. Check the WV DNR hunting season calendar for exact dates.

## Nearby Pairing: Glade Creek Grist Mill

The iconic Glade Creek Grist Mill is located inside Babcock State Park, approximately 1 minute drive from the main parking areas. Even if trail conditions are poor for riding, the mill is worth the visit as one of West Virginia's most photographed landmarks. Note that the mill building may be closed in winter, but the exterior and surrounding scenery remain accessible. [UNVERIFIED]
