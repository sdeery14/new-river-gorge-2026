## February Conditions

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Freeze/thaw | Primary concern — frozen ground in morning, softening midday on sunny days above 32 F. Riding during thaw causes lasting trail damage. |
| Mud risk | **HIGH** — Appalachian dirt singletrack at peak mud vulnerability in February. Stay off when soft. |
| Ice risk | **MODERATE** — shaded sections can hold ice for days after freeze events |
| Snow | Common in Fayette County in February; accumulation may make trails impassable |
| Seasonal closures | No formal seasonal closure documented [UNVERIFIED]; community ethic is to stay off when trails are soft or muddy |
| Best riding days | After 2-3 dry days with temps below freezing; early morning on frozen ground before midday thaw |
| Overall viability | **FAIR** — Conditionally rideable in February. Trail conditions vary day-to-day and even hour-to-hour with freeze/thaw. Respect the trails: if you leave ruts, turn around. |
