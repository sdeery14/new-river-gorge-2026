# Mountain Biking — New River Gorge Region

> Quick reference for morning trail selection. Pick a system based on today's conditions, drive time, and difficulty preference.

## Trail Systems

| System | Drive | Difficulty | Mileage | February | Tier | Best For |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|------|----------|
| [Arrowhead Trails](arrowhead.md) | ~5-10 min | 🟢 Green — ⬛ Black | ~10-13 mi | FAIR | Primary | Default day; closest to town; free |
| [Summit Bechtel Reserve](summit-bechtel.md) | ~12-18 min | 🟢 Green — ⬛⬛ Dbl. Black | ~30-40 mi | UNCERTAIN | Conditional | Best trails in region IF accessible |
| [Babcock State Park](babcock.md) | ~30-35 min | 🟢 Green — 🔵 Blue | ~5-10 mi | LOW-MOD | Supplementary | Scenic light ride; Grist Mill |

**Viability key**: Good (ride most days) · Fair (check conditions) · Poor (rarely rideable) · Uncertain (verify access)

**Tier key**: Primary (default pick) · Conditional (verify access before planning) · Supplementary (side trip / light ride)

All data [UNVERIFIED]. See individual profiles for details.

## Quick Decision Guide

- **Dry + cold + frozen ground** → [Arrowhead Trails](arrowhead.md) — closest, free, purpose-built singletrack. Ride early on frozen ground before midday thaw.
- **Wet / muddy** → **Skip riding.** Go boulder instead — see [Bouldering Areas](../areas/README.md). Riding muddy trails causes lasting damage. Respect the trails.
- **Want the best trails** → [Summit Bechtel Reserve](summit-bechtel.md) — by far the most trail mileage and variety. BUT: private BSA facility, public access uncertain. **Must call (304) 465-2800 to verify access before driving.**
- **Short on time** → [Arrowhead Trails](arrowhead.md) — 5-10 min from town, ride in under an hour.
- **Scenic light ride** → [Babcock State Park](babcock.md) — old roads and railroad grades through state park. Pair with Glade Creek Grist Mill visit. Not purpose-built MTB.
- **All trails unrideable** → Pivot to an all-bouldering day. See [Bouldering Areas](../areas/README.md). This is expected in February — mountain biking in mid-February WV is opportunistic, not guaranteed.

## IMBA Difficulty Scale

| Rating | Symbol | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Green Circle | 🟢 | Easiest — wide, smooth, gentle grade |
| Blue Square | 🔵 | Intermediate — moderate terrain, some obstacles |
| Black Diamond | ⬛ | Difficult — steep, technical, significant obstacles |
| Double Black Diamond | ⬛⬛ | Expert only — extreme terrain, mandatory features |

*Standard IMBA (International Mountain Bicycling Association) trail rating system. Similar to ski resort difficulty ratings.*

## February Riding Tips

*For freeze/thaw timeline details and how to pair morning rides with afternoon bouldering, see [Conditions Guide → Freeze/Thaw Guide](../conditions/README.md#freezethaw-guide).*

- **Freeze/thaw is the #1 concern.** Trails are rideable when frozen solid (early morning) but become mud pits when the surface thaws midday. The best window is 7-10 AM on cold, sunny days after several dry days.
- **Do NOT ride muddy trails.** Riding wet singletrack creates ruts that persist for months. If your tires leave impressions deeper than ~1 inch, turn around. This is a community ethic, not just a suggestion.
- **Check conditions morning-of.** Trail conditions can change overnight with a single freeze or rain event. Check Trailforks, call a local shop, or check Active SWV Facebook before heading out.
- **Dress in layers.** February mornings start at 18-28°F but sunny afternoons can reach 48°F. Wind chill on descents is significant. Bring windproof outer layer and warm gloves.
- **Carry microspikes.** If you need to hike any section, icy trail surfaces are common in shaded areas. Small microspikes clip to shoes easily.
- **Blaze orange at Babcock.** WV hunting seasons may extend into early-mid February. Wear blaze orange if riding at Babcock State Park.
- **Mountain biking in mid-February WV is opportunistic.** You may get zero rideable days during the trip. Plan bouldering as the primary activity and treat riding as a bonus when conditions allow.

## Bouldering-Area Pairings

> Combine a morning ride with an afternoon boulder session. Minimize driving, maximize the day.

| Pairing | Trail → Boulder | Total Day | Schedule | Weather Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| [Arrowhead](arrowhead.md) + [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) | ~10-15 min | ~25-40 min | Ride AM → Boulder PM | **Best pairing** — both close to town. Works on frozen AM / dry PM days. |
| [Arrowhead](arrowhead.md) + [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | ~35-40 min | ~45-55 min | Ride AM → Boulder PM | Ride frozen trails early, drive to Meadow River for overhanging boulders. |
| [Summit Bechtel](summit-bechtel.md) + [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) | ~15-20 min | ~30-45 min | Ride AM → Boulder PM | Good if Summit is accessible. Gorge Boulders has cliff-base shelter. |
| [Summit Bechtel](summit-bechtel.md) + [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | ~35-45 min | ~50-65 min | Ride AM → Boulder PM | Longer drive day. Best for dry conditions at both sites. |
| [Babcock](babcock.md) + [Summersville Lake](../areas/summersville-lake.md) | ~20-30 min | ~85-100 min | Ride AM → Boulder PM | Scenic day — Grist Mill + winter drawdown boulders. Longer total drive. |
| [Babcock](babcock.md) + [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | ~45-55 min | ~110-125 min | Ride AM → Boulder PM | Long drive day — not recommended unless Babcock is the goal. |

**How to use this table**: Pick a pairing based on conditions and drive tolerance. "Total Day" is approximate round-trip driving from Fayetteville (home → trail → boulders → home).

**Rain-day pivot**: If rain starts mid-morning, abandon the ride and head to sheltered bouldering. Best rain-day bouldering options:
- [Gorge Boulders → Endless Wall](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) — cliff-base overhangs stay dry during active rain (5-15 min from town)
- [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) — heavily overhanging roadside problems shed rain (~30 min from town)
- See [Bouldering Areas](../areas/README.md) for full rain-day guide

## Bike Rentals

> **⚠️ February Warning**: There is a **HIGH RISK that no bike rental shop will be open** in mid-February. Fayetteville (~2,800 pop.) has an overwhelmingly seasonal outdoor economy (May-October). Plan to bring your own bikes.

| Shop | Location | Price | Bikes | February | Contact |
|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Ridge Rider MTB | Fayetteville [UNVERIFIED] | ~$40-100/day [UNVERIFIED] | Hardtail, full suspension [UNVERIFIED] | Unknown — best option | Search Facebook/web [UNVERIFIED] |
| ACE Adventure Resort | Oak Hill (~15 min) | [UNVERIFIED] | Hardtail [UNVERIFIED] | Unlikely (seasonal) | (800) 787-3982 / aceraft.com |
| Adventures on the Gorge | Lansing (~5-10 min) | [UNVERIFIED] | [UNVERIFIED] | Unlikely (seasonal) | (855) 379-8738 |
| New River Bikes | Fayetteville area [UNVERIFIED] | [UNVERIFIED] | [UNVERIFIED] | Unknown | [UNVERIFIED] |

**If no rentals are available** (likely in February):
1. **Bring your own bikes** — most reliable option
2. **Rent in a larger town** en route — check shops in Charleston or Beckley before driving to Fayetteville
3. **Contact Ridge Rider in advance** — call or message ahead to arrange a special-request February rental
4. **Skip riding** — pivot to an all-bouldering day (see [Bouldering Areas](../areas/README.md))

All rental data [UNVERIFIED]. Call ahead to confirm availability.
