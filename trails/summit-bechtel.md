## Trail Summary

Per-trail inventory is not fully available from public sources. The following represents **estimated trail categories** based on the known trail system design. All individual trail data is [UNVERIFIED].

| Trail / Zone | Difficulty | Distance | Elev. Gain | Surface | Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Beginner Flow Loop | 🟢 Green | ~2-3 mi | ~150 ft | Machine-built dirt | Gentle berms, wide corridor |
| Skills Area / Pump Track | 🟢 Green | ~0.5 mi | Minimal | Machine-built dirt | Pump track, skills features, drops |
| Connector / Fire Road Network | 🟢 Green — 🔵 Blue | ~8-12 mi | Varies | Gravel fire road | Links between trail zones |
| Intermediate Flow Trails | 🔵 Blue | ~4-6 mi | ~300-500 ft | Machine-built dirt | Berms, rollers, tabletops |
| XC Singletrack | 🔵 Blue — ⬛ Black | ~6-10 mi | ~500-800 ft | Natural surface singletrack | Climbs, technical features, roots |
| Advanced Flow / DH Trails | ⬛ Black | ~3-5 mi | ~400-700 ft | Machine-built dirt | Steep berms, gap jumps, drops |
| Expert Lines | ⬛⬛ Dbl. Black | ~1-3 mi | ~300-600 ft | Natural / built | Rock gardens, steep chutes, mandatory drops |

*All distances, elevations, and features are [UNVERIFIED] estimates based on publicly available descriptions of the trail system. Actual trail names, counts, and specs require on-site or direct-from-source confirmation.*

## February Conditions

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Freeze/thaw | Frequent — machine-built dirt trails are especially vulnerable to damage during freeze/thaw cycles |
| Mud risk | **HIGH** — riding wet flow trails causes lasting damage to shaped surfaces |
| Ice risk | **MODERATE-HIGH** — shaded north-facing trails retain ice; bermed corners collect and freeze water |
| Snow | Possible accumulation at elevation; trails may be impassable after storms |
| Seasonal closures | Many Appalachian trail systems close Nov-April for trail protection. Summit Bechtel may follow a similar or stricter policy as a managed facility. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Best riding days | Extended cold snaps (frozen, dry ground) or sustained dry periods after thaw |
| Overall viability | **UNCERTAIN** — Even if the facility grants public access in February, trail conditions may independently close the system. Double-check both access AND conditions before driving. |
