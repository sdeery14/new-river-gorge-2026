# Sheltered Classics — Rain-Day Reference

> Problems climbable during active rain. Organized by area and grade band.

## How to Use

1. It's raining → open this document
2. Pick an area based on drive time and group energy
3. Find your grade band → all listed problems have shelter
4. Shelter type tells you how dry you'll stay (Sheltered > Partial)

> **Quick pick**: Meadow River for flat landings and easy approach. Gorge Boulders (Endless Wall) for the most sheltered problems. Summersville Lake has almost no shelter — skip in rain.

## Meadow River

*Rain resilience: Good — [Area Profile](meadow-river.md) — [Problem Clusters](problems-meadow-river.md)*

Best rain-day area overall: most sheltered problems with flat landings, easy roadside approach, no gorge descent.

### V7-V10+

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter Type | Landing | Location |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| ⭐ The Horizon | V10 | Roof / compression | Boulder roof | Uneven | Large roof boulder near road |
| ⭐ Meadow King | V9 | Overhang / crimp | Cliff-base overhang | Flat | Tall overhanging face, roadside |
| Dark Side of the Moon | V8 | Overhang / compression | Boulder overhang | Uneven | Large overhang, river-left |
| River Dance | V7 | Overhang / dynamic | Overhanging face (partial) | Uneven | Riverside block |

### V4-V6

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter Type | Landing | Location |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| ⭐ The Wave | V6 | Compression / overhang | Boulder overhang | Flat | Wave-shaped overhang near road |
| Pocket Rocket | V6 | Overhang / pockets | Overhanging face (partial) | Flat | Roadside |
| ⭐ Iron Cross | V5 | Overhang / cross-body | Cliff-base overhang | Uneven | Cliff-base boulder |
| River Runner | V5 | Traverse / overhang | Overhanging face (partial) | Uneven | Long traverse, river boulders |

| Easy Overhang | V0 | Overhang / jug | Boulder overhang | Flat | Short overhang with positive holds |

## Gorge Boulders

*Rain resilience: Good (Endless Wall, Nuttall) / Fair (Bridge Buttress) — [Area Profile](gorge-boulders.md) — [Problem Clusters](problems-gorge-boulders.md)*

Highest shelter ratio of any area (65%). Cliff-base overhangs provide natural roof coverage. Landings are uneven talus — bring spotters and multiple pads.

> **February caution**: Gorge descent trails can be icy. Microspikes recommended. Kaymoor problems omitted from this rain-day list (approach too dangerous when wet/icy).

### V7-V10+

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter Type | Landing | Location |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| ⭐ The Punisher | V9 | Roof / compression | Cliff-base roof | Uneven | Endless Wall, cliff base near Fern Creek |
| ⭐ Endless Roof | V8 | Roof | Cliff-base roof | Uneven | Endless Wall, massive roof under headwall |
| Nuttall Roof | V8 | Roof | Cliff-base roof | Poor | Nuttall, prominent roof under cliff band |
| Bridge Power | V8 | Overhang / power | Cliff-base overhang (partial) | Uneven | Bridge Buttress, overhanging block |
| Gorge Power | V7 | Overhang / power | Cliff-base overhang | Poor | Endless Wall, deep cliff base |
| Fern Buttress Problem | V7 | Overhang / crimp | Cliff-base overhang | Uneven | Nuttall, Fern Buttress cliff base |
| Buttress Roof | V7 | Roof | Cliff-base roof | Uneven | Bridge Buttress, short roof |

### V4-V6

## Summersville Lake

*Rain resilience: Poor — [Area Profile](summersville-lake.md) — [Problem Clusters](problems-summersville-lake.md)*

> **Not a rain-day area.** Zero fully sheltered problems. Only 5 problems have partial shelter. Listed here for completeness — these offer some protection in light drizzle but will NOT keep you dry in real rain. Go to Meadow River or the Gorge instead.

### V7-V10+ (Partial shelter only)

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter Type | Landing | Location |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| ⭐ Orange Oswald | V10 | Overhang / crimp | Cliff-base overhang (partial) | Uneven | Orange Oswald Wall area |
