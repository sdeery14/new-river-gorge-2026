# Meadow River

> **Drive**: ~30 min from Fayetteville | **Rain Resilience**: Good | **Problems**: ~50-100 [UNVERIFIED] | **Land**: Private / county road ROW [UNVERIFIED]

> [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=38.0210,-80.8590) [UNVERIFIED] | Take US-19 S to US-60 E toward Meadow Bridge

## Grade Spread

| V0-V3 (Beginner) | V4-V6 (Intermediate) | V7-V10+ (Hard) |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Some (15-30) — jugs, easy overhangs, traverses [UNVERIFIED] | Many (20-40) — overhanging faces, compression, pinches [UNVERIFIED] | Some (10-25) — steep compression, roof pulls, powerful sequences [UNVERIFIED] |

## Group Suitability

Good for all levels. V4-V6 density is highest — great for intermediate climbers. Hard climbers have Some V7-V10+ options on steep, powerful rock. Beginners have enough V0-V3 to stay busy. Full day area.

## Weather Resilience

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Rating** | Good |
| **Shelter** | Many problems on heavily overhanging faces/roofs — stay dry during rain. **Hard problems (V7+) are predominantly sheltered** — the steep compression and roof lines that define hard climbing here are the same features that provide rain protection. |
| **Seepage** | Some on crack systems and horizontal breaks after heavy/prolonged rain [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Drying** | Overhanging = already dry. Vertical = 1-3 hrs with sun+wind. Steep nature means faster drying overall. |
| **Wind** | Moderate — river corridor funnels wind, aids drying |
| **Rain verdict** | Yes — overhanging problems climbable during active rain. Best rain-day bouldering option in the region. |

## Sectors

### Main Area / Roadside [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Good | Some | Many | Some | Roadside = wind-exposed but overhanging faces stay dry |

Most accessible sector. Freestanding blocks visible from the road. Shortest approach — park at pulloff and walk to boulders. Wind-exposed due to open roadside position, but overhanging rock provides rain shelter.

### River Boulders [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Good | Some | Many | Some | Some natural shelter from river bank terrain |

Along the Meadow River bank, short walk from pulloffs. May need creek crossing to reach some boulders. Good spread across all grades with natural shelter provided by river bank terrain.

### Upstream / Upper Meadow [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Fair (less documented) | Few | Few | Few | Limited — less documented shelter |

Less developed sector with additional potential. Limited problems and less documentation means shelter and drying characteristics are not well established.

## Approach & Access

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Parking** | Gravel pulloffs along road. ~5-10 vehicles per pulloff. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Approach** | 50-200 yards (roadside) to 0.25 miles (river). 2-10 min. |
| **February hazards** | Minimal — short, flat approaches. River crossing may be needed for some boulders. |
| **Winter access** | US-60 is state highway, plowed year-round. Pulloffs may accumulate snow. [UNVERIFIED] |

## Regulations

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Land manager** | Private / county road ROW [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Crash pads** | Permitted [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Chalk** | Permitted [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Seasonal closures** | None known [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Fees** | None [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Brushing** | No specific restrictions [UNVERIFIED] |

## Climbing Style

Nuttall sandstone. Predominantly overhanging — steep faces, compression, roofs, aretes. The rock is characteristically hard and featured with crimps, pinches, slopers, and horizontal rails. Powerful, athletic climbing on bullet-hard sandstone. Landing zones vary from flat roadside dirt to uneven riverside talus.
