# Bouldering Areas — New River Gorge Region

> Quick reference for morning area selection. Pick based on today's weather and group energy.

## Area Summary

| Area | Drive | Rain | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Best For |
|------|-------|------|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| [Meadow River](meadow-river.md) | ~30 min | Good | Some | Many | Some | Default day; rain fallback |
| [Summersville Lake](summersville-lake.md) | ~35 min | Poor | Many | Many | Some | Dry days; beginners; drawdown season |
| [Gorge Boulders](gorge-boulders.md) | 5-15 min | Good-Fair | Few | Few | Few | Rain shelter; quick session; combine w/ hiking |

**Density key**: Many (20+) · Some (5-19) · Few (1-4)

## Quick Decision Guide

- **Dry + cold + sunny** → [Meadow River](meadow-river.md) — best all-around. Overhanging rock + cold friction = prime sending conditions. Or [Summersville Lake](summersville-lake.md) for volume and beginners.
- **Raining now** → [Gorge Boulders → Endless Wall / Nuttall cliff-base overhangs](gorge-boulders.md) — cliff-base roof shelter keeps overhang problems completely dry during active rain. Or [Meadow River → overhanging sector](meadow-river.md) — heavily overhanging roadside problems shed rain; best rain-day volume. Avoid [Summersville Lake](summersville-lake.md) — exposed lakeshore, no shelter.
- **Rain stopped, drying** → Check the [drying reference table](#nuttall-sandstone-drying-reference) below. Overhangs: already dry at all areas. Vertical faces: Meadow River dries fastest (wind + steep angle, 1-3 hrs with sun). Summersville Lake: exposed but no overhang, 3-6+ hrs. Gorge Boulders: shaded gorge floor = slowest drying for vertical (6-12 hrs overcast). **Do not climb wet Nuttall sandstone.**
- **Short session / low energy** → [Gorge Boulders → Bridge Buttress](gorge-boulders.md) — 5-15 min approach, closest to town. Easy problems at the cliff base.
- **Hard climbing priority** → [Meadow River](meadow-river.md) — best V7-V10+ density on steep, powerful rock. Or [Gorge Boulders → Endless Wall](gorge-boulders.md) for sheltered hard lines.

## Nuttall Sandstone Drying Reference

| Condition | Overhanging | Vertical | Slab |
|-----------|------------|----------|------|
| Light rain → sun + wind | Already dry | 1-3 hrs | 2-4 hrs |
| Heavy rain → sun + wind | Already dry | 3-6 hrs | 4-8 hrs |
| Heavy rain → overcast | Dry (seepage possible) | 6-12 hrs | 12-24 hrs |
| Multi-day soaking | Seepage on breaks | 12-24+ hrs | 24-48+ hrs |

**Community ethic**: Do not climb on wet Nuttall sandstone. The rock is more friable when saturated. This is a rock-preservation concern shared by NRAC and the NRG climbing community.

*Note: February cold slows evaporation. Add 20-50% to drying times in overcast/freezing conditions.* [UNVERIFIED]
