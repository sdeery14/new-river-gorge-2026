# Summersville Lake

> **Drive**: ~35 min from Fayetteville | **Rain Resilience**: Poor | **Problems**: ~150-250 [UNVERIFIED] — highest density in region | **Land**: USACE (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)
>
> [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=38.1350,-80.8920) [UNVERIFIED] (Long Point trailhead) | Take US-19 N ~20 mi, exit toward Summersville Lake / WV Rt. 129

**KEY FEATURE — Winter Drawdown**: USACE draws Summersville Lake down ~77 ft from summer pool (~1,652 ft) to winter pool (~1,575 ft). February is at or near maximum drawdown, exposing extensive lakeshore boulders that are submerged in summer. The exposed lakebed provides flat sandstone landing zones — the best crash pad placements in the region. Problem counts include both year-round and drawdown-exposed boulders; drawdown problems are only available roughly November through April.

## Grade Spread

| V0-V3 (Beginner) | V4-V6 (Intermediate) | V7-V10+ (Hard) |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Many (60-100) — slabs, easy traverses, low-angle faces. Best beginner bouldering in the region. [UNVERIFIED] | Many (50-90) — vertical faces, crimps, technical footwork [UNVERIFIED] | Some (15-40) — steeper faces and overhangs on larger cliff-base blocks [UNVERIFIED] |

## Group Suitability

Excellent for mixed-ability groups. Best beginner area in the region with abundant V0-V3 on friendly low-angle lakeshore blocks. Intermediate climbers have the most volume (Many V4-V6). Hard climbers have Some options but this is not the primary draw. Great for a full day with flat, comfortable landing zones on exposed lakebed sandstone. Best choice when the group includes first-time boulderers.

## Weather Resilience

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Rating** | Poor |
| **Shelter** | Very little — most boulders are freestanding on exposed lakeshore, no overhead canopy or cliff shelter. **Hard problems (V7+) are mostly exposed** — the steeper cliff-base blocks offer slightly more overhang but remain largely unprotected from rain. |
| **Seepage** | Minimal (freestanding blocks), but surface water pools on flat lakebed after rain |
| **Drying** | Slow for vertical/slab. Exposed lakeshore gets good wind and sun but lack of overhang means rain hits all surfaces. 3-6+ hrs for vertical after rain. |
| **Wind** | Exposed — significant wind on lakeshore. Aids drying but uncomfortable in cold. |
| **Rain verdict** | No — not recommended during active rain. Virtually all problems exposed. Wait for dry conditions. |

## Sectors

### Long Point [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Poor | Many | Many | Some | No shelter |

Most reliable winter access point. Boulders along the lakeshore below the Long Point trail. Best documented sector at Summersville Lake. **Recommended starting point for February visits** — the Long Point trailhead off WV Rt. 129 is the most reliably open year-round.

### Pirates Cove [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Poor | Many | Some | Few | No shelter |

Lakeshore bouldering west of Long Point. Good beginner problems on low-angle exposed blocks. Access road may be gated November through April [UNVERIFIED].

### Orange Oswald Wall Area [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Poor | Some | Some | Few | Minimal cliff-base shelter |

Cliff-base boulders below the Orange Oswald Wall. More vertical character than the lakeshore sectors. Slight cliff-base shelter provides marginally better rain protection than fully exposed lakeshore boulders.

### Dam Area / Salmon Run [UNVERIFIED]

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Poor | Few | Few | Few | No shelter |

Boulders near the dam outflow on the Gauley River side. Less documented than other sectors. May require alternate winter access — check with USACE before relying on this sector in February [UNVERIFIED].

## Approach & Access

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Parking** | Long Point Trailhead — small gravel lot, ~10-15 vehicles. Off WV Rt. 129. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Approach** | ~0.5-1.0 mile from Long Point trailhead, ~150-250 ft descent, 15-25 min [UNVERIFIED] |
| **February hazards** | Trail can be muddy/icy. Exposed lakebed slippery when wet/icy. Microspikes helpful. |
| **Winter access** | Some USACE access roads gated Nov-Apr. Long Point trailhead is the most reliable year-round access. [UNVERIFIED] Call USACE (304) 872-3459 to confirm. |

## Regulations

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Land manager** | USACE (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) — NOT NPS |
| **Crash pads** | Permitted [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Chalk** | Permitted [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Seasonal closures** | None for climbing, but access roads may be gated [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Fees** | None for lakeshore access [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Brushing** | No specific restrictions [UNVERIFIED] |

## Climbing Style

Sandstone bouldering on lakeshore blocks and cliff-base boulders. The lakeshore problems tend toward slabs and vertical faces — technical footwork, crimps, delicate balance. Less overhanging than Meadow River or Gorge Boulders. The winter-drawdown-exposed boulders often have water-polished surfaces. Flat sandstone lakebed provides excellent landing zones — the best crash pad placements in the region.
