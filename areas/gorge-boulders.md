## Grade Spread

| V0-V3 (Beginner) | V4-V6 (Intermediate) | V7-V10+ (Hard) |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Few (12-27) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (14-33) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (9-24) — predominantly overhanging, cliff-base boulders [UNVERIFIED] |

## Group Suitability

Limited for beginners — approaches involve steep gorge descents (150-800 ft), and problems are on talus and cliff-base blocks with uneven landings. Best for experienced boulderers comfortable with gorge hiking. The short approach at Bridge Buttress is the most beginner-friendly access point. Not a full-day bouldering destination for large groups — combine with gorge hiking or sightseeing.

## Weather Resilience

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Rating** | Good-Fair (varies by sector; Endless Wall/Nuttall = Good, Bridge Buttress/Kaymoor = Fair) |
| **Shelter** | Cliff-base overhangs provide natural roof coverage at Endless Wall and Nuttall sectors. **Hard problems (V7+) are predominantly sheltered** — concentrated on overhanging cliff-base blocks beneath the headwall, which are the most protected features in the gorge. |
| **Seepage** | Seepage on crack systems and breaks, especially in drainage areas (Fern Creek) |
| **Drying** | Overhangs = already dry. Gorge floor is shaded — vertical faces dry slower than exposed areas. |
| **Wind** | Sheltered — deep gorge reduces wind at cliff base |
| **Rain verdict** | Yes (Endless Wall / Nuttall sectors) — cliff-base overhang boulders stay dry during active rain. Bridge Buttress has some shelter. Best active-rain option in the gorge. |

## Sectors

### Endless Wall / Fern Creek

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Good | Few (5-10) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (5-12) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (3-8) — overhanging compression, roofs [UNVERIFIED] | Excellent — cliff overhangs create natural rain shelter at cliff base |

Iconic cliff line along the gorge's north side. Cliff-base talus boulders and freestanding blocks beneath overhanging Nuttall sandstone headwall. Overhanging faces, roofs, compression, and aretes with uneven talus landings — careful pad placement required. Fern Creek drainage at the eastern end has more concentrated bouldering.

- **Parking GPS**: 38.0670 N, -81.0785 W (Endless Wall Trailhead, paved NPS lot, ~15-20 vehicles) [UNVERIFIED]
- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=38.0670,-81.0785) [UNVERIFIED]
- **Access**: From Fayetteville, US-19 N to Lansing-Edmond Rd (CR 82). ~10 min drive. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: 0.7-1.0 mi, 250-350 ft descent, 20-35 min. Well-maintained NPS rim trail, then steeper climber spur trails to cliff base.
- **Feb hazards**: North-facing descent = icy. Wooden boardwalks icy when frozen. Microspikes essential. Mud at cliff base.

### Nuttall / Fern Buttress

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Good | Few (3-6) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (3-8) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (2-5) [UNVERIFIED] | Good — cliff-base overhangs similar to Endless Wall |

Less trafficked than Endless Wall with similar character. Overhanging Nuttall sandstone compression and vertical face problems on talus blocks. Also accessible from the Endless Wall / Fern Creek trailhead.

- **Parking GPS**: 38.0710 N, -81.0835 W (Long Point Trailhead, small NPS lot, ~10 vehicles) [UNVERIFIED]
- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=38.0710,-81.0835) [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: 0.5-1.0 mi, 200-300 ft descent, 15-30 min. NPS trail + climber spur trails.
- **Feb hazards**: Similar to Endless Wall — icy descent, less foot traffic = less maintained trail in winter.

### Bridge Buttress

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Fair | Few (3-7) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (4-8) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (2-5) [UNVERIFIED] | Moderate — some cliff-base shelter but more open/exposed than deep gorge sectors |

Shortest approach in the gorge. Mixed vertical face and overhanging problems on freestanding blocks and cliff-base boulders adjacent to the New River Gorge Bridge. Less consistently overhanging than Endless Wall or Nuttall — more exposed to rain. The bridge itself does NOT provide rain shelter for bouldering.

- **Parking GPS**: 38.0705 N, -81.0830 W (Fayette Station area) OR Canyon Rim Visitor Center 38.0700 N, -81.0750 W [UNVERIFIED]
- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=38.0705,-81.0830) [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: SHORTEST in the gorge — 0.2-0.4 mi, 100-200 ft descent, 5-15 min. NPS trail with stairs.
- **Feb hazards**: Short approach reduces exposure. BUT Fayette Station Road may be closed in icy conditions — if closed, approach from Canyon Rim Visitor Center (longer, ~0.5-0.7 mi). [UNVERIFIED]

### Kaymoor

> **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FEBRUARY** — The famous Kaymoor steel staircase (800+ steel grate steps) becomes extremely dangerous when iced. Long approach (30-50 min, 600-800 ft descent) means extended exposure. Do not use as a primary bouldering destination in February unless conditions have been dry and above freezing for several consecutive days.

| Rain Resilience | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Shelter |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Fair (excellent cliff-base shelter BUT approach hazard negates rain-day usability) | Few (1-4) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (2-5) [UNVERIFIED] | Few (2-6) — overhanging character suggests harder problems dominate [UNVERIFIED] | Excellent cliff-base overhang shelter (extremely overhanging cliff) — negated by dangerous approach |

Historic coal mining area on the south side of the gorge. Extremely overhanging cliff character produces predominantly overhanging and roof problems on cliff-base blocks. The cliff-base overhang shelter is among the best in the gorge, but the approach — featuring the Kaymoor miners' steel staircase with 800+ steel grate steps — makes this sector impractical and dangerous in winter conditions.

- **Parking GPS**: 38.0580 N, -81.0690 W (Kaymoor Trailhead, small NPS lot, ~8-12 vehicles) [UNVERIFIED]
- [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=38.0580,-81.0690) [UNVERIFIED]
- **Access**: From Fayetteville, cross bridge, turn onto Kaymoor Road. ~10 min drive. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Feb hazards**: Steel grate steps are inherently slippery when wet or icy. Shaded sections of the staircase may be iced for extended periods. Microspikes essential but provide poor traction on steel grate. 800+ step return ascent is strenuous.

## Approach & Access

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Parking** | NPS lots at each trailhead. Canyon Rim Visitor Center (large, plowed) is the safest winter bet. |
| **Approach** | Varies by sector (5-50 min, 100-800 ft descent). All involve gorge descents. |
| **February hazards** | Icy trails are the primary concern. Microspikes essential for all gorge descents. |
| **Winter access** | Canyon Rim Visitor Center area is reliable. Fayette Station Road may be closed in ice/snow. [UNVERIFIED] |

## Regulations

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Land manager** | NPS (National Park Service) — NRG National Park |
| **Crash pads** | Permitted [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Chalk** | Permitted (brush tick marks) [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Seasonal closures** | None in February (peregrine closures March-July) [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Fees** | None [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Brushing** | Nylon/boar's hair only — no wire brushes [UNVERIFIED] |

## Climbing Style

Nuttall sandstone bouldering on cliff-base talus blocks and freestanding boulders deep in the New River Gorge. The rock is characteristically overhanging, with steep compression, roofs, and powerful sequences. Landings are generally uneven talus — careful crash pad placement required. The gorge setting provides dramatic scenery and natural shelter from rain and wind at the cliff base.
