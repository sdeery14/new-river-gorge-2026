# Summersville Lake — Problem Clusters

> Curated problems by grade band. ⭐ = classic. [Area Profile](summersville-lake.md)

## Summary

| Grade Band | Curated | Classics | Sheltered |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| V7-V10+   | 6       | 2        | 0         |
| V4-V6     | 13      | 3        | 0         |
| V0-V3     | 13      | 3        | 0         |

> **Shelter note**: Zero fully sheltered problems. 5 problems have partial shelter (cliff-base overhangs or boulder overhangs): Orange Oswald, Lake Monster (V7-V10+); Orange Peel, Cove Overhang (V4-V6); Cove Jug Haul (V0-V3).
>
> **Rain resilience**: Poor — virtually all problems are exposed on the lakeshore. Not recommended during active rain.
>
> **Winter drawdown context**: USACE draws Summersville Lake down ~77 ft each winter, exposing additional lakeshore boulders with flat sandstone landings. Some problems (Drawdown, Drawdown Slab) are winter-only. Long Point is the most reliable winter access point. ~35-40 min drive from Fayetteville.
>
> **Beginner note**: Highest V0-V3 count in the region — best beginner bouldering area.
