## Your Daily Decision Matrix

> Check the weather, check your energy, find your plan in 30 seconds.
> Temperature thresholds, drying times, and time windows [UNVERIFIED] — adjust based on actual conditions.

| Scenario | Do This | Go Here | Time Window | Why |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Clear + cold (28-35°F, frozen) | Bike AM → Boulder PM | [Arrowhead](../trails/arrowhead.md) → [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | Ride 7-10 AM, climb 12-4 PM | Frozen trails are your best ride window; Meadow River has your sheltered classics after thaw |
| Clear + warm (40-55°F, dry) | Boulder all day | [Summersville Lake](../areas/summersville-lake.md) | 9 AM - 5 PM | Your best beginner area — 13 problems, all flat landings, sun exposure warms the rock |
| Overcast + dry (35-45°F) | Boulder | [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | 10 AM - 4 PM | Good friction temps; wind exposure aids drying; your 6 problems are right off the road |
| Active rain | Overhangs or Rest | [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) or [town](#your-food--drink-picks) | Overhangs anytime | Cliff-base overhang keeps Gorge Warm-Up (V2) dry; otherwise hit Cathedral Cafe |
| Post-rain + clearing | Wait → Boulder (overhangs first) | [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | Overhangs: now. Vertical: 2-6 hrs | Meadow River dries fastest (wind + sun + steep); start with The Warm-Up and Juggy Roof |
| Freeze/thaw (28-38°F, sun) | Bike AM → Boulder PM | [Arrowhead](../trails/arrowhead.md) → [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) | Ride 7-10 AM, climb 1-4 PM | Frozen ground holds for early ride; gorge boulders shelter from wind while rock thaws |
| Windy + dry (10+ mph) | Boulder (sheltered area) | [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) | 11 AM - 4 PM | Gorge floor is sheltered from westerly wind; your fingers won't freeze |
| Extended wet (2+ rain days) | Rest day | [Downtown Fayetteville](#your-rest-day-flow) | All day | Hit your food picks, Water Stone Outdoors for beta, Canyon Rim Boardwalk if breaks clear |
| Low energy / sore | Easy boulder or rest | [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) or [town](#your-food--drink-picks) | Flex | Meadow River has short approach (50-200 yds) and easy classics; or just rest |

**If trails are too wet to ride**: Don't ride — riding wet trails causes lasting damage. Default to bouldering. Your best option is Meadow River (quick approach, sheltered problems) or Summersville Lake (if it's sunny).

**If all areas are wet (nuclear rest day)**: Head to town. Your plan: Cathedral Cafe for brunch → Water Stone Outdoors for guidebooks and local beta → Canyon Rim Boardwalk (15 min, easy) → Pies & Pints for pizza and beer. See [Your Rest-Day Flow](#your-rest-day-flow) below. Full weather details: [Conditions Guide](../conditions/README.md).

## Your Bouldering Hit List

> Your problems, your grade. Classics marked with ⭐. All problem data [UNVERIFIED].

### Summersville Lake — Your Best Beginner Area

Your #1 area for quality V0-V3 climbing. Most beginner problems in the region (13 named), all flat lakebed landings (safest for pad placement), and excellent slab variety for building footwork. February drawdown (~77 ft [UNVERIFIED]) exposes extra boulders with flat sandstone landings. Head here on sunny dry days. **Not a rain-day area** — virtually no shelter.

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Note |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|------|
| Long Point Warm-Up | V0 | Slab / jug | Exposed | ⭐ Your easiest entry — safest beginner slab, flat lakebed landing |
| The Ramp | V0 | Slab / easy | Exposed | Lowest-angle feature — natural ramp, pure footwork |
| Sunset Slab | V0 | Slab | Exposed | ⭐ West-facing — best afternoon sun for warming and drying |
| Cove Jug Haul | V0 | Overhang / jug | Partial | Only partially sheltered problem — some rain protection at Pirates Cove |
| Lakeshore Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | ⭐ Iconic beginner slab — winter-drawdown accessible, textbook footwork |
| Easy Traverse | V1 | Traverse | Exposed | ⭐ Low friendly traverse — great for warming up |
| Drawdown Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Winter-only (drawdown-exposed) — bonus problem for your February trip |
| Pirate Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Variation slab at Pirates Cove — explore after Long Point |
| Beginner's Luck | V2 | Vertical / jug | Exposed | Positive holds on short wall — vertical technique intro |
| Short Stack | V2 | Vertical face | Exposed | Technical footwork on short wall — low exposure |
| The Platform | V2 | Slab / mantle | Exposed | Flat-top boulder — combo slab-to-mantle movement |
| Sandy Mantle | V3 | Mantle | Exposed | Lakebed boulder — mantle technique progression |
| Lakeside Steps | V3 | Vertical / steps | Exposed | Stepped holds teach body positioning — your V3 project |

**Full area profile**: [Summersville Lake](../areas/summersville-lake.md)

### Meadow River — Your Rain-Day Backup & Default Crag

Your go-to for rainy days and short sessions. 6 problems with flat landings and short approaches (50-200 yds from your car). Three problems are sheltered under overhanging rock — your best rainy-day climbing. Head here when Summersville is too wet or when you want a quick session.

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Note |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|------|
| Easy Overhang | V0 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | Rain-proof opener — sheltered under boulder overhang |
| The Warm-Up | V1 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | ⭐ Your first climb of any Meadow River session — obvious jug ladder, near parking |
| Beginner Traverse | V1 | Traverse | Exposed | Low roadside traverse — endurance building, flat landing |
| River Slab | V2 | Slab | Exposed | River boulder — technical footwork, flatter than Summersville slabs |
| Juggy Roof | V2 | Roof / jug | Sheltered | ⭐ Your beginner-friendly roof — big holds, sheltered, climbable in rain |
| Meadow Mantle | V3 | Mantle / vertical | Exposed | Roadside mantle — your V3 mantle project |

**Full area profile**: [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md)

### Gorge Boulders — Shelter Day Only

Honest assessment: limited V1-V3 options for you here (6 usable problems, excluding Kaymoor which is **too dangerous in February** due to 800+ icy steel grate steps). All landings are uneven talus — harder pad placement than Meadow River or Summersville. The gorge's value for you is **rain shelter**: cliff-base overhangs stay completely dry during active rain. Come here when it's raining and you still want to climb.

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Note |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|------|
| Easy Wall | V0 | Vertical face | Partial | Short face near cliff base — minimal features but sheltered |
| Easy Bridge | V0 | Vertical / jug | Partial | Bridge Buttress base — shortest approach in gorge (5-15 min) |
| Fern Creek Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Trailside convenience at Endless Wall — talus landing, be careful |
| Bridge Slab | V1 | Slab / vertical | Exposed | Near Bridge Buttress — quick access from Fayette Station area |
| Fern Slab | V1 | Slab | Partial | Near Fern Buttress — partial cliff shelter helps drying |
| Gorge Warm-Up | V2 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | ⭐ Your one must-do gorge problem — fully sheltered, juggy, works in rain |

**⚠️ Kaymoor sector**: Skip entirely in February. 800+ steel grate steps [UNVERIFIED] are extremely slippery when icy/frosted. Two more V1-V2 problems exist there but are not worth the risk.

### Your Skills Progression (V0 → V3)

Build your skills across styles as you work through the trip:

| Style | Start Here | Progress To | Goal |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Slab | Long Point Warm-Up (V0) | Lakeshore Slab (V1) → River Slab (V2) | Lakeside Steps (V3) |
| Overhang | Easy Overhang (V0) | The Warm-Up (V1) → Juggy Roof (V2) | Gorge Warm-Up (V2) |
| Traverse | Easy Traverse (V1) | Beginner Traverse (V1) | — (endurance building) |
| Mantle | The Platform (V2) | Meadow Mantle (V3) | Sandy Mantle (V3) |

## Your Mountain Biking Priority Stack

> Ride whenever conditions allow. Don't default to "just boulder."
> Drive times, trail mileage, and access fees [UNVERIFIED] — verify before driving.

| Rank | Trail | Drive | Conditions Gate | Fallback |
|------|-------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | [Arrowhead Trails](../trails/arrowhead.md) | 5-10 min | Frozen ground — ride before 10 AM | Boulder Meadow River or Gorge |
| 2 | [Summit Bechtel Reserve](../trails/summit-bechtel.md) | 12-18 min | Any dry day + **confirmed access** (call first) | Ride Arrowhead instead |
| 3 | [Babcock State Park](../trails/babcock.md) | 30-35 min | Dry roads + park roads open | Ride Arrowhead instead |
| — | **Don't ride today** | — | All trails soft/muddy after thaw + rain | Boulder or rest day |

**⚠️ February reality**: Mountain biking in mid-February WV is opportunistic, not guaranteed. You may get zero rideable days. Plan bouldering as your primary activity and treat riding as a bonus when conditions align. **Never ride wet or soft trails** — riding muddy trails causes lasting damage to the trail system.

### #1: Arrowhead Trails

Your default ride. 5-10 minutes from town, free, always open, ~10-13 miles [UNVERIFIED] of purpose-built singletrack from green to black. The trick in February: ride early on frozen ground (7-10 AM) before temperatures hit 35°F and the ground turns to mud. Pairs perfectly with afternoon bouldering — ride Arrowhead AM, then head to Gorge Boulders or Meadow River PM. After your ride, grab a beer at The Handle Bar + Kitchen at Arrowhead Bike Farm.

### #2: Summit Bechtel Reserve

The premium option *if* you can get in. 30-40 miles of trail [UNVERIFIED], green to double black, the most variety in the region. But it's a private BSA facility — public access is NOT guaranteed. Likely $5-20/day [UNVERIFIED], waiver required. **You MUST call (304) 465-2800 or check summitbsa.org before driving.** If accessible on a dry day, this is your best ride of the trip. Pairs with Gorge Boulders or Meadow River.

### #3: Babcock State Park

Your scenic backup. 5-10 miles [UNVERIFIED] on old roads and railroad grades (not purpose-built MTB), 30-35 minutes away. Lower priority because: longer drive, lower trail quality, interior park roads may be gated in winter. Call (304) 438-3004 to check road access. If you go, wear blaze orange — WV hunting season may extend into early February [UNVERIFIED]. Best as a relaxed scenic ride, not a technical session.
