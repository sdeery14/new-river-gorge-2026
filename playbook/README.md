# Decision Trigger Playbook — Chattanooga vs New River Gorge

> **The question**: Do we stick with Chattanooga or pivot to New River Gorge?
> Check the forecast, follow the tree, make the call.
> **Trip dates**: February 14-21, 2026.

---

## Quick-Reference Decision Tree

> Start here. Check the Chattanooga 7-day forecast. Follow the first row that matches.

| Chattanooga Forecast | NRG Forecast | Decision | Confidence | Action |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 3+ consecutive rain days | Mostly dry (0-1 rain days) | **PIVOT TO NRG** | High | Switch all bookings |
| 3+ consecutive rain days | Mixed (2 rain days) | **PIVOT TO NRG** | Moderate | NRG has better rain shelter; switch bookings |
| 3+ consecutive rain days | Also 3+ rain days | **Compare shelter** | Low | See [Contingency Paths](#contingency-paths) |
| 2 rain days (non-consecutive) | Mostly dry | **STAY Chattanooga** | Moderate | Chattanooga dries faster; 2 rain days manageable |
| 2 rain days (non-consecutive) | Also 2+ rain days | **STAY Chattanooga** | Low | Default to original plan; both similar |
| 0-1 rain days | Any | **STAY Chattanooga** | High | No reason to switch |

**How to read the forecast**: A "rain day" = any day the forecast shows rain as the primary condition (rain icon, >50% chance). Don't overthink probability percentages — if the forecast says rain, count it.

**Which window are you at?** The right action depends on when you're checking:
- [7 days out (Feb 7)](#7-day-window--feb-7) — Start watching. Book backup if flexible.
- [3 days out (Feb 11)](#3-day-window--feb-11) — **Make the call.** This is the critical decision point.
- [1 day out (Feb 13)](#1-day-window--feb-13) — Confirm or emergency pivot.

## Decision Windows

### 7-Day Window — Feb 7

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Date** | Saturday, February 7, 2026 |
| **Forecast reliability** | Low — general trends only. Patterns can shift significantly. |
| **Booking flexibility** | High — most reservations still changeable with minimal cost |
| **Decision type** | Preliminary — start watching, prepare to act |

**Trigger criteria**:

| Chattanooga Forecast | Trigger? | Action |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| 3+ consecutive rain days | Yes — Yellow alert | Book backup NRG lodging (flexible/refundable). Check NRG access (call Summersville Lake gates, Summit Bechtel). Do NOT cancel Chattanooga yet. |
| 2 rain days or scattered | No — Watch | Note the pattern. Check again at 3-day window. No action needed. |
| 0-1 rain days | No — Clear | Chattanooga looks good. No action needed. |

**What you can still do at 7 days**:
- Book backup lodging at both destinations (use flexible cancellation policies)
- Hold Southwest flights (free cancellation)
- Reserve Pay Later rental cars for both locations (free cancellation)
- Call NRG access points: Summersville Lake (304) 872-3459, Summit Bechtel (304) 465-2800, Babcock (304) 438-3004

**What you should NOT do**: Cancel Chattanooga bookings based on a 7-day forecast. It will change. [UNVERIFIED — forecast accuracy degrades beyond 5 days]

---

### 3-Day Window — Feb 11

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Date** | Tuesday, February 11, 2026 |
| **Forecast reliability** | Moderate — pattern confidence is high enough to act |
| **Booking flexibility** | Medium — depends on your cancellation policy tier (see [Booking Timeline](#booking--cancellation-timeline)) |
| **Decision type** | **Firm — make the call** |

**This is the critical decision point.** Forecasts are reliable enough to trust. Most flexible bookings are still changeable. After this, options narrow.

**Trigger criteria**:

| Chattanooga Forecast | NRG Forecast | Trigger? | Action |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 3+ consecutive rain days | Better than Chattanooga | **YES — PIVOT** | Cancel Chattanooga lodging. Book NRG lodging. Switch rental car pickup to Charleston, WV. Adjust flights if possible. |
| 3+ consecutive rain days | Also bad (3+ rain) | **MAYBE** | See [Contingency Paths](#contingency-paths). Compare rain shelter at each destination. |
| 2 rain days | Any | **NO — STAY** | Chattanooga has faster drying and more reliable access. 2 rain days are manageable with rest days and rain-shelter areas (Dayton Pocket). |
| 0-1 rain days | Any | **NO — STAY** | Clear sailing for Chattanooga. |

**Financial check**: Before switching, check your [booking timeline](#booking--cancellation-timeline). Can you still cancel Chattanooga lodging? What's the sunk cost? Is it cheaper to eat the loss or push through?

---

### 1-Day Window — Feb 13

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Date** | Thursday, February 13, 2026 |
| **Forecast reliability** | High — hour-by-hour accuracy |
| **Booking flexibility** | Low — most non-refundable costs are locked in |
| **Decision type** | Final — confirm or emergency pivot |

**If you already made the call at 3-day**: Confirm the forecast still supports your decision. No action needed unless it flipped dramatically.

**Emergency pivot criteria** (only if you haven't switched yet):

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Chattanooga forecast worsened dramatically (was 1 rain day, now 4+) | Assess switching cost. If lodging/flights are flexible → pivot. If sunk costs are high → ride it out with rain-shelter areas. |
| Already committed to NRG but forecast improved for Chattanooga | **Stay with NRG.** The logistics of switching back at 1 day are almost never worth it. Sunk costs + stress > marginal weather gain. |
| Both forecasts are bad | Accept it. Pick the destination with better rain shelter. See [Contingency Paths](#contingency-paths). |

**After this window**: You're on the trip. Daily decisions are handled by the [Conditions Guide](../conditions/README.md#daily-decision-framework).

## Weather Comparison: Chattanooga vs New River Gorge

> Side-by-side assessment of February climbing conditions at each destination. Use this to evaluate the forecasts at each [decision window](#decision-windows).

| Factor | Chattanooga, TN | New River Gorge, WV | Advantage |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Feb avg high** | 51-59°F | 42-45°F | Chattanooga (warmer) |
| **Feb avg low** | ~35°F | 23-27°F | Chattanooga (less cold) |
| **Dew point** | 31-33°F (excellent friction) | Similar range [UNVERIFIED] | Tie |
| **Rain events per week** | 2-3 expected | 2-3 expected | Tie |
| **Min drying time** | Variable: 4-48 hrs depending on area | Mandatory 24+ hrs (community standard) | Chattanooga (faster options) |
| **Rain shelter areas** | 1-2 (Dayton Pocket gorge, some HP40 overhangs) | 2-3 (Gorge overhangs, Meadow River overhangs) | NRG (more shelter) |
| **Winter access risk** | Low (no documented closures) | Moderate (icy roads, gated areas, Kaymoor steps) | Chattanooga (more reliable) |
| **Est. climbable days / 7** | 4-5 [UNVERIFIED] | 3-5 [UNVERIFIED] | Chattanooga (slightly more) |

All weather data [UNVERIFIED] — based on historical averages and regional climate data, not live forecasts.

**Bottom line**: Chattanooga is the better default — warmer, faster drying, more reliable access. Only pivot to NRG when Chattanooga's forecast is genuinely bad (3+ consecutive rain days). NRG's advantage is rain shelter: more overhanging boulders that stay dry during active rain.

## Booking & Cancellation Timeline

> What can you still change at each decision window? Check your actual booking policies against this framework.

### Cancellation Flexibility by Booking Type

| Booking Type | Best Strategy | Free Cancel Window | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Flights** | Southwest Airlines | Free cancellation anytime (travel credit, expires 6 months) | Other airlines: free cancel on non-basic-economy fares. Avoid basic economy. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Lodging** | VRBO Relaxed or Airbnb Flexible | 7-14+ days before check-in | Strict policies: may only allow 50% refund at 7-14 days. Check YOUR booking's specific policy. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Rental car** | Book "Pay Later" (not prepaid) | Free until pickup time | Prepaid: $50-150 cancellation fee. Pay Later costs slightly more per day but maximum flexibility. [UNVERIFIED] |

### Financial Exposure at Each Decision Window

| Window | Flights | Lodging | Rental Car | Total Exposure |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **7-day (Feb 7)** | $0 (Southwest) | $0 (if flexible policy) | $0 (Pay Later) | **$0 — full flexibility** |
| **3-day (Feb 11)** | $0 (Southwest) | $0-50% (depends on policy) | $0 (Pay Later) | **$0 to moderate** |
| **1-day (Feb 13)** | $0 (Southwest) | 50-100% (most strict policies) | $0 (Pay Later) | **Moderate to high** |

All cost estimates [UNVERIFIED] — actual amounts depend on your specific bookings.

### Your Booking Checklist

Fill in your actual booking details so the decision windows are actionable:

| Booking | Provider | Policy Tier | Free Cancel Deadline | Est. Sunk Cost if Late |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Chattanooga flights | _______________ | _______________ | _______________ | $_______________ |
| NRG flights | _______________ | _______________ | _______________ | $_______________ |
| Chattanooga lodging | _______________ | _______________ | _______________ | $_______________ |
| NRG lodging | _______________ | _______________ | _______________ | $_______________ |
| Rental car (CHA) | _______________ | _______________ | _______________ | $_______________ |
| Rental car (CRW) | _______________ | _______________ | _______________ | $_______________ |

**Pro tip**: Book both destinations with flexible policies early. The small premium for flexibility pays for itself when the forecast goes sideways.

## Mid-Week Roster Considerations

> One member departs ~Wednesday (Feb 18), another arrives ~Wednesday. A late destination switch complicates their logistics.

If the destination switches at the 7-day or 3-day window:

| Affected Person | Issue | Action |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| **Departing member** (leaves Wed) | May have Chattanooga flight booked | Rebook to depart from Charleston, WV (CRW) instead of Chattanooga (CHA). ~1.5 hr drive from Fayetteville. |
| **Arriving member** (arrives Wed) | May have Chattanooga flight booked | Rebook to arrive at CRW. Coordinate rental car or pickup from Fayetteville. |
| **Group logistics** | Car count changes at midpoint | Verify rental car pickup/dropoff locations match the chosen destination. CRW for NRG, CHA for Chattanooga. |
| **Lodging** | Headcount changes at midpoint | If switching to NRG: confirm Fayetteville lodging accommodates the roster change (capacity for 5 → 5, with different people). |

**If switching at the 1-day window**: Mid-week members' flights are likely locked. Assess whether it's better to eat the flight change fee or have them arrive at the "wrong" airport and drive. Charleston, WV (CRW) to Chattanooga is ~6 hrs; Chattanooga to Fayetteville is ~5.5 hrs. Neither is ideal. [UNVERIFIED — drive times approximate]

## Contingency Paths

> When the decision tree doesn't give a clear answer.

### Scenario 1: Both Destinations Have 3+ Rain Days

**Assessment**: Compare rain shelter, not total rain days.

| Factor | Chattanooga | NRG | Better For Rain |
|--------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Sheltered bouldering areas | 1-2 (Dayton Pocket roof problems) | 2-3 (Gorge overhangs, Meadow River overhangs) | **NRG** |
| Drying speed after rain stops | 4-48 hrs (sun + wind dependent) | 24+ hrs minimum | **Chattanooga** |
| Non-climbing rain activities | More options (mid-size city) | Fewer options (small town) | **Chattanooga** |
| Access disruption risk in rain | Low | Moderate (icy roads, gated areas) | **Chattanooga** |

**Recommendation**: If you expect to climb during rain (overhangs only), **NRG is better** — more sheltered bouldering volume. If you expect to wait for drying windows between rain events, **Chattanooga is better** — faster drying and more rest-day options. If rain is truly continuous with no breaks, **Chattanooga** — better non-climbing options in a mid-size city.

---

### Scenario 2: Committed to NRG but Key Access Closed

You've switched to NRG, but a key access point is confirmed closed (Summersville Lake gates, icy roads).

**Still viable with reduced scope**:

| Area | Access Status | Why It's Still Worth Going |
|------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Gorge Boulders (Endless Wall, Nuttall) | Always accessible from Fayette Station / Canyon Rim | Best rain shelter in the region. 5-15 min from town. |
| Meadow River | Road access (US-60 E) rarely affected | Best all-around area. Sheltered overhangs. ~30 min drive. |
| Arrowhead Trails (MTB) | Free, always open | Closest trails. Rideable on frozen ground. |

**Not viable if closed**:

| Area | Closure Risk | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Summersville Lake | USACE gates may close Nov-Apr | Lose best beginner area (13 V0-V3 problems). Still have Meadow River and Gorge for easy problems. |
| Babcock State Park (MTB) | Interior roads gated in winter | Lose scenic backup ride. Arrowhead and Summit Bechtel still available. |
| Summit Bechtel (MTB) | Private — access not guaranteed | Lose best trail system. Arrowhead still available. |
| Kaymoor sector | Icy steel steps — not recommended Feb | Already excluded from trip plan. No impact. |

**Recommendation**: NRG is still worth the trip even if Summersville Lake is closed. Gorge Boulders + Meadow River + Arrowhead Trails provide a solid week. Only abandon NRG if BOTH Gorge Boulders access (Fayette Station Rd) AND Meadow River access (US-60 E) are simultaneously closed — extremely unlikely.

---

### Scenario 3: Forecast Reversal After Pivot Decision

You switched to NRG at the 3-day window, but now Chattanooga's forecast has improved.

**Decision framework**:

| When Did You Notice? | Booking Status | Recommendation |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| At 1-day window (Feb 13) | NRG bookings locked | **Stay with NRG.** Switching back costs money and stress. NRG will still be a good trip. |
| At 1-day window (Feb 13) | NRG bookings still flexible | Assess: is Chattanooga now clearly better (0-1 rain days vs NRG 2+)? If yes, switch back. If marginal, stay with NRG. |
| During the trip | Already in Fayetteville | **Stay.** You're here. Make the best of it. Use the [Conditions Guide](../conditions/README.md) for daily decisions. |

**General rule**: Once you've committed, the bar for switching back should be very high. The stress and cost of a second switch almost never justify the marginal weather improvement.
