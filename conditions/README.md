## Can I Climb Right Now?

Check the rock. Match the state. Follow the action.

| Rock State | Safe to Climb? | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Dry** — normal color, chalk sticks as powder, "bitey" texture | YES | Climb. Best friction in cold + dry conditions. |
| **Damp** — looks dry but chalk pastes, palm darkens rock | NO | Wait. Surface dry ≠ friction restored. Re-test in 1-3 hrs. |
| **Wet** — visible moisture, dark rock, water in cracks | NO | Do not climb. Rock is weakened. See [Drying Reference](#drying-reference). |
| **Frozen (dry)** — below freezing, no moisture, rock never got wet | YES | Climb. Excellent friction on cold dry rock. Watch for ice on holds. |
| **Thawing** — 30-34°F, thin meltwater film, deceptively slick | NO | **Most dangerous state.** Wait for full thaw + drying. See [Freeze/Thaw Guide](#freezethaw-guide). |

**Quick tests**:
- **Palm test**: Press palm flat on rock for 10 seconds. If palm is damp or rock darkens → not ready.
- **Chalk test**: Apply chalk to rock. Sticks as powder = ready. Forms paste or absorbs = not ready.
- **If in doubt, wait.** The community standard is 24 hours after rain minimum.

## Nuttall Sandstone Primer

Nuttall sandstone is the rock you'll climb on throughout the New River Gorge region. Understanding how it behaves in different conditions is essential for safe climbing and rock preservation.

### What Is Nuttall Sandstone?

Nuttall sandstone is a **Pennsylvanian-age quartz arenite** (~320-330 million years old) that forms the cliff bands lining the New River Gorge. It is frequently called "bullet-hard" by climbers — one of the hardest sandstones used for climbing anywhere in the world.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Quartz content | ~98% (quartz arenite) [UNVERIFIED] |
| Cementation | Silica cement (quartz overgrowths) + secondary goethite along joints [UNVERIFIED] |
| Hardness | Very hard — likened to granite by climbers [UNVERIFIED] |
| Surface texture | Textured, granular — edges, crimps, shallow features [UNVERIFIED] |
| Cliff height | 30-120 ft (10-35 m), typically 15-30 m at bouldering areas [UNVERIFIED] |

**Why "bullet-hard"**: At ~98% quartz (Mohs hardness 7) bonded by silica cement — chemically identical to the grains — Nuttall sandstone is nearly a monolithic quartz mass. The outer surface develops a hardened rind (case hardening) from mineral precipitation, making the climbing surface even harder than the interior rock. This is why NRG holds withstand decades of traffic with minimal degradation. [UNVERIFIED]

### Friction Behavior

| Condition | Friction | Chalk | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Cold + dry (25-35°F)** | EXCELLENT | Very effective — skin stays dry | Best friction. Peak sending temps. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Cool + dry (35-50°F)** | Very good | Effective | Standard good conditions. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Wet rock (any temp)** | POOR | Counterproductive — forms paste | Do not climb. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Frozen dry rock** | EXCELLENT | Effective | Skin grips well in cold. Rubber OK above ~20°F. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Frozen wet / ice film** | ZERO | Not applicable | Extremely dangerous. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Thawing (30-34°F)** | DANGEROUS | Ineffective | Invisible meltwater film. Worst combination. [UNVERIFIED] |

**Why wet rock is slick**: Water fills pore spaces between quartz grains, eliminating the micro-edge contact that provides dry friction. Chalk cannot absorb enough water from a saturated rock surface — it forms a viscous paste that further reduces grip. [UNVERIFIED]

**Why cold dry rock is excellent**: Cold skin produces less sweat. Dry skin conforms to grain edges better than damp skin. The coefficient of friction of quartz against skin is essentially constant across normal outdoor temperatures. Climbing shoe rubber maintains good friction into the low 30s°F but degrades below ~20°F as it hardens. [UNVERIFIED]

### Seepage Patterns

Water enters Nuttall sandstone from above — rain infiltrates the plateau surface and migrates down through the rock to emerge on cliff faces. Three primary pathways:

1. **Horizontal bedding planes** — Water migrates laterally along boundaries between sandstone layers. Emerges as horizontal wet streaks across the wall face. [UNVERIFIED]
2. **Vertical crack systems** — Tectonic joints and fractures provide pathways between bedding planes. Water emerges as vertical seep lines or drips from crack openings. [UNVERIFIED]
3. **Formation contacts** — The boundary between permeable sandstone and impermeable shale below acts as a perched water table. Produces cliff-base seepage. [UNVERIFIED]

**Critical pattern**: Seepage often **increases 4-8 hours after rain stops**. Water that infiltrated the plateau during rain takes hours to migrate through the rock and emerge on cliff faces. A wall can become *wetter* in the evening after morning rain ended. [UNVERIFIED]

| Wall Type | Seepage Behavior |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Overhangs (>110°)** | Minimal — gravity pulls seepage away from the face. Drips into space, not down the wall. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Vertical (85-95°)** | Seepage runs down the face from breaks, wetting everything below the seep line. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Slab (<85°)** | Maximum retention — rain pools on low-angle features, seepage sheets across surface. [UNVERIFIED] |

### Why You Must Not Climb Wet Sandstone

This is a **rock preservation** concern, not just a safety issue.

- **Water weakens grain bonds.** Even Nuttall sandstone — harder than most — loses an estimated 15-20% of its strength when saturated. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Most weakening happens in the first 20% of saturation.** Even damp rock is substantially weaker than fully dry rock. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Hold breakage is permanent.** A broken hold changes a problem forever. The best holds (thinnest, most textured) are the most vulnerable. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Cumulative damage matters.** One session may not visibly harm the rock. Thousands of climbers over years will. The community ethic protects the resource for decades. [UNVERIFIED]

**The community ethic at NRG is clear: do not climb wet sandstone.** Enforced through community norms by NRAC (New River Alliance of Climbers), local climbers at Water Stone Outdoors, and consistent with Access Fund guidance: "Don't climb on wet sandstone, full stop." [UNVERIFIED]

| Situation | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| Rock visibly wet | Do not climb. No exceptions. |
| Looks dry but rained in last 24 hrs | Palm test + chalk test first. If in doubt, wait. |
| Overhangs that stayed dry during rain | Climbable IF surface was never wet AND seep lines at breaks are dry. |
| Seepage on otherwise dry face | Do not climb the seepage zone. Wait for seep to dry. |

---

## Drying Reference

How long after rain until the rock is climbable? Match your wall angle to current conditions.

| Wall Angle | Sun + Wind | Overcast | Overcast + Cold |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Overhang (>110°)** | Already dry (0-1 hr if seep-affected) | Already dry (check seepage at breaks) | Already dry (check seepage at breaks) |
| **Vertical (85-95°)** | 2-6 hrs | 6-12 hrs | 8-16 hrs |
| **Slab (<85°)** | 4-12 hrs | 12-24 hrs | 24-48+ hrs |

All drying times are [UNVERIFIED] estimates for February conditions.

**February modifier**: Add 20-50% to base drying times. February's combination of cold temps (30-45°F highs), high humidity (84% average — highest month of the year), and limited sun on the gorge floor makes it the worst month for drying. [UNVERIFIED]

### "Surface Dry" vs. "Friction Restored"

These are two different states. Confusing them risks unsafe climbing and rock damage.

| State | What It Looks Like | Safe to Climb? |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Visibly wet** | Dark rock, water in cracks | NO |
| **Surface dry** | Normal color returned, looks dry — but chalk pastes, palm darkens rock under pressure | NO — rock still weakened |
| **Friction restored** | Chalk sticks as powder, skin grips with "bitey" feel, rock doesn't darken under pressure | YES — full friction |

**Time lag**: After rain stops:
1. Visibly wet → Surface dry: depends on wall angle + sun + wind (see table above)
2. Surface dry → Friction restored: typically **1-3 additional hours** in good conditions, up to **4-8 additional hours** in poor conditions [UNVERIFIED]

This lag is why the community standard is **24 hours after rain** minimum — it provides margin for the surface-dry-to-friction-restored transition even in poor drying conditions. [UNVERIFIED]

**Cross-reference**: See the drying table in [areas/README.md](../areas/README.md#nuttall-sandstone-drying-reference) for a simplified version. See [Per-Area Weather Matrix](#per-area-weather-matrix) for area-specific drying modifiers.

## Freeze/Thaw Guide

February averages an estimated **18-22 days** where the temperature crosses 32°F at least once. Freeze/thaw transition is the most dangerous period for climbing. [UNVERIFIED]

### Freeze/Thaw Phases

| Phase | Temp | Rock State | Safe to Climb? |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|
| **1. Fully frozen** | Below ~28°F | Ice solid in pores/surface. If rock was dry before freezing = unchanged. | YES (if dry-frozen). NO (if wet-frozen — ice on surface). |
| **2. Thaw begins** | 28-34°F, sun on rock | Outer surface thaws while interior stays frozen. Thin invisible meltwater film. | **NO — MOST DANGEROUS.** Looks dry, feels slick without warning. |
| **3. Active thaw** | 32-38°F | Ice in pores melts. Seepage lines activate. Rock is visibly wet. | NO — too warm for frozen grip, too wet for dry grip. |
| **4. Thaw complete** | Above 36°F, steady | All ice melted. Rock is wet from thaw water, beginning to dry. | WAIT — normal drying timeline applies from here. |

### Typical February Freeze/Thaw Timeline

This assumes a below-freezing night after a dry previous day:

| Time | Temp | What's Happening | Climbing? |
|------|------|-----------------|-----------|
| 6:00 AM | 22-28°F | Everything frozen. Trail ice. | No — too cold, icy approaches. |
| 8:00 AM | 25-30°F | Sun hits rim. Gorge floor still shadowed and frozen. | Frozen dry rock OK if accessible. |
| 9:30-10:00 AM | 30-34°F | **THAW TRANSITION — DANGER.** Thin meltwater film on sun-hit rock. | **NO — do not climb.** |
| 10:30-11:00 AM | 33-37°F | Active thaw. Rock weeping, seepage activating. | No — rock is wet. |
| 11:30 AM-12:00 PM | 36-40°F | Drying begins on exposed surfaces. | No — still drying. |
| 1:00-3:00 PM | 40-45°F | **CLIMBABLE.** Surface dry, friction restoring. | YES — best afternoon window. |
| 4:00-5:00 PM | 36-40°F | Cooling. Approaching refreeze in shadows. | Marginal — conditions declining. |

All times [UNVERIFIED] — actual timing varies with weather, aspect, and cloud cover.

**Key takeaway**: On a freeze/thaw day, the **climbable window is approximately 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM** on south-facing rock after the thaw transition completes. North-facing gorge rock may not become climbable at all on marginal days. [UNVERIFIED]

### Freeze/Thaw and Trail Conditions

Frozen trails are icy — carry **microspikes** for gorge approaches (Endless Wall ladders, Kaymoor stairs). North-facing descents hold ice for days after freeze events.

Frozen dirt trails can actually be *rideable* in early morning (firm, not muddy). See [trails/README.md February Riding Tips](../trails/README.md#february-riding-tips) — a "biking morning on frozen trails" pairs well with an "afternoon bouldering session" after the rock thaws and dries.

### Typical February Day Timeline

| Time | Temp | Conditions | Climbing Impact |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 6:00 AM | 22-28°F | Below freezing, frost/ice | Not climbing yet. Trails icy. |
| 8:00 AM | 25-30°F | Sun hitting rim; gorge floor shadowed | South-facing rim rock warming. Gorge frozen. |
| 10:00 AM | 30-36°F | Crossing freezing threshold | **Danger zone** — ice melting, wet film on rock. |
| 12:00 PM | 36-42°F | Above freezing, peak solar angle | Best friction window if dry. Sun reaching gorge. |
| 2:00 PM | 40-45°F | Daily high | Good conditions if dry. |
| 4:00 PM | 36-42°F | Cooling begins, shadows lengthen | Still climbable. Friction improving as temps drop. |
| 5:30 PM | 30-35°F | Near sunset, rapid cooling | End of climbing day. Approaching refreeze. |

All temperatures [UNVERIFIED]. The "golden window" for February bouldering is roughly **11:00 AM to 4:00 PM**.

### What to Expect in a 7-Day Window

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|------------|
| 0 climbable days | ~3-5% [UNVERIFIED] |
| 1-2 climbable days | ~15-20% [UNVERIFIED] |
| **3-4 climbable days** | **~35-40% (most likely)** [UNVERIFIED] |
| 5-6 climbable days | ~25-30% [UNVERIFIED] |
| 7 climbable days | ~5-10% [UNVERIFIED] |

**Plan for 3-5 climbable days and 2-4 rest/rain days.** "Climbable day" doesn't mean fully dry everywhere — overhangs may be climbable while vertical faces are still wet.

## Daily Decision Framework

> Check the forecast, match the scenario, go to the recommended area.

| Scenario | Temp | Precip | Wind | Do This | Go Here | Time Window |
|----------|------|--------|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Clear + cold + frozen** | <35°F | None | Any | CLIMB — best friction | [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) (sheltered) or [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) | 11 AM - 4 PM (after thaw) |
| **Clear + warm** | 40-55°F | None | Any | CLIMB — all options open | [Summersville Lake](../areas/summersville-lake.md) (solar oven) or any area | 9 AM - 5 PM |
| **Overcast + dry** | 35-45°F | None | Light | CLIMB — good temps | [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) (best overcast day) | 10 AM - 4 PM |
| **Active rain** | Any | Rain | Any | Overhangs only or REST | [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) (cliff shelter) or RIDE (frozen trails) | Overhangs anytime; ride AM |
| **Post-rain + sunny + wind** | 40°F+ | Clearing | 5+ mph | WAIT then CLIMB — overhangs first | [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) (fastest drying) | Overhangs: now. Vertical: 2-6 hrs. |
| **Freeze/thaw transition** | 28-38°F | None | Any | RIDE AM, CLIMB PM | [Arrowhead](../trails/arrowhead.md) AM → [Gorge Boulders](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) PM | Ride 7-10 AM, climb 1-4 PM |

**Rain-day options**:
- Climb overhangs at [Gorge Boulders → Endless Wall/Nuttall](../areas/gorge-boulders.md) — cliff-base roof keeps overhang problems dry during active rain
- Climb overhangs at [Meadow River](../areas/meadow-river.md) — heavily overhanging roadside problems shed rain
- Ride frozen trails at [Arrowhead](../trails/arrowhead.md) if ground is frozen (early morning before thaw)
- Rest day in Fayetteville — see trail profiles in [trails/](../trails/README.md) for town activity ideas

**Post-rain drying priority**: Head to overhangs first (already dry), then check vertical faces. Meadow River dries fastest → Summersville Lake moderate → Gorge Boulders slowest. See [Per-Area Weather Matrix](#per-area-weather-matrix) for details.

## Wind Patterns

### How the Gorge Affects Wind

The New River Gorge runs roughly **north-south** and is ~1,000 ft deep. Prevailing February winds are from the **west**. This geometry creates a critical shelter effect:

- **Westerly wind (most common)**: Blows perpendicular to the gorge. Gorge walls block the wind. **Gorge floor is sheltered** — calm to light breeze even on windy days. [UNVERIFIED]
- **North or south wind (less common)**: Aligns with the gorge axis. Wind **funnels** through the gorge, potentially reaching 50-80% of ambient speed at the gorge floor. [UNVERIFIED]

| Location | Wind Behavior |
|----------|--------------|
| Gorge rim / bridge level | Full exposure to prevailing winds. Uncomfortable in cold. |
| Gorge floor / cliff base | Sheltered from westerly wind. Calm most February days. |
| Summersville Lake | Fully exposed. Open lakeshore catches full wind. |
| Meadow River | Moderate. River corridor provides partial shelter. |

### Wind and Climbing

**Wind aids drying** — air movement carries humid air away from rock surface, speeding evaporation. But wind also creates **wind chill** that reduces climbing comfort and finger dexterity.

| Air Temp | Calm | 10 mph | 20 mph |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 40°F | 40°F | 34°F | 30°F |
| 35°F | 35°F | 27°F | 24°F |
| 30°F | 30°F | 21°F | 17°F |
| 25°F | 25°F | 15°F | 11°F |

Wind chill values [UNVERIFIED] — NWS formula.

**Comfort zones**:
- Above 30°F feels-like: manageable with layers
- 20-30°F feels-like: hand warmers needed, dexterity drops
- Below 20°F feels-like: marginal — many climbers would choose a rest day

**At the gorge floor** (sheltered): feels-like temp ≈ actual air temp. This is a major advantage of gorge climbing in winter. **At Summersville Lake** (exposed): feels-like can be 10-15°F lower than air temp on windy days. [UNVERIFIED]

### Drying Speed Ranking

| Rank | Area | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 1 (fastest) | **Meadow River** | Open roadside + river-corridor wind + moderate sun. Steep rock sheds water quickly. |
| 2 | **Summersville Lake** | Excellent sun and wind exposure. BUT all surfaces get wet (few overhangs) — must evaporate everything. |
| 3 (slowest) | **Gorge Boulders** | Deep shade + no wind + high humidity. Vertical faces are worst-case drying. Overhangs stay dry under cliff base. |

All rankings [UNVERIFIED]. Head to Meadow River first after a rain event for the fastest recovery.
