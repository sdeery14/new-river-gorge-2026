# Research: Decision Trigger Playbook

## Section 1: Chattanooga vs NRG February Weather Comparison

### Decision
Use a side-by-side comparison framework with 7 consistent metrics: temperature range, rain frequency, dew point, drying speed, rain shelter options, winter access risk, and climbable-day estimate.

### Findings

**Chattanooga, TN (February)**:
- Average high: 51-59°F, average low: ~35°F
- Average dew point: 31-33°F (excellent for sandstone friction)
- Rain days: 13-14 per month (expect 2-3 rain events in a 7-day window)
- Precipitation: ~4.1 inches for the month
- Drying times: Variable by area — Stone Fort 2-4 hrs (light rain, sun); 24-48 hrs standard; deep woods 36-48 hrs
- Rain shelter: Dayton Pocket gorge (roof problems stay dry); some HP40 overhangs
- Winter access disruption: Minimal — no documented snow closures

**New River Gorge, WV (February)**:
- Average high: 42-45°F, average low: 23-27°F
- Freeze/thaw days: 18-22 per month
- Multi-day rain events: 2-3 per February
- Humidity: 84% average (highest month — slowest drying)
- Climbable days in 7-day window: 3-5 expected (35-40% probability)
- Mandatory drying time: 24+ hours after rain (conservative community standard)
- Rain shelter: Gorge Boulders cliff-base overhangs (stay dry in rain); Meadow River overhanging sector
- Winter access disruption: Moderate — Fayette Station Rd may close in ice, Summersville Lake gates may close Nov-Apr, Kaymoor steps icy

### Key Comparison

| Factor | Chattanooga | NRG | Advantage |
|--------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| Temperature range | 35-59°F | 23-45°F | Chattanooga (warmer lows) |
| Dew point | 31-33°F | Estimated similar | Tie |
| Rain events per week | 2-3 | 2-3 | Tie |
| Min drying time | Variable 4-48 hrs | Mandatory 24+ hrs | Chattanooga (faster options) |
| Rain shelter count | 1-2 areas | 2-3 areas | NRG (more sheltered options) |
| Winter access risk | Low | Moderate | Chattanooga (more reliable) |
| Climbable days / 7 days | 4-5 estimated | 3-5 estimated | Chattanooga (slightly more) |

### Rationale
NRG's advantage is rain shelter — more areas with overhanging boulders that stay dry during active rain. Chattanooga's advantage is warmer temperatures, faster drying, and more reliable access. The trigger should favor Chattanooga as default and only pivot to NRG when Chattanooga's weather is genuinely bad (3+ consecutive rain days).

## Section 2: Airline Cancellation Policies

### Decision
Recommend Southwest Airlines for maximum flexibility. Document all major carrier policies for the booking timeline.

### Findings

| Airline | Cancel Policy | Refund Type | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Southwest | Free cancellation anytime | Travel credit (expires 6 months) | Maximum flexibility |
| Delta | Free cancel (most fares, not basic economy) | Credit or refund depending on fare | Good flexibility |
| United | Free cancel (non-basic-economy) | Credit | Moderate flexibility |
| American | Free cancel (most fares, not basic economy) | Credit | Moderate flexibility |

**DOT Rule**: All airlines must provide automatic refunds if THEY cancel or significantly change the flight (>3 hrs domestic).

### Rationale
Southwest offers the most flexible cancellation policy. For a trip where the destination may change 3-7 days before departure, airline flexibility is critical. Basic economy fares on other carriers should be avoided.

## Section 3: Lodging Cancellation Policies

### Decision
Recommend booking with VRBO Relaxed or Moderate cancellation tier, or Airbnb with at least 14-day flexible cancellation.

### Findings

**Airbnb Tiers**:
| Policy | Full Refund | 50% Refund | No Refund |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Flexible | >24 hrs before check-in | — | <24 hrs |
| Moderate | >5 days before | — | <5 days |
| Strict | >14 days AND within 48 hrs of booking | 7-14 days before | <7 days |

**VRBO Tiers**:
| Policy | Full Refund | 50% Refund | No Refund |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Relaxed | >14 days | 7-14 days | <7 days |
| Moderate | >30 days | 14-30 days | <14 days |
| Firm | >60 days | 30-60 days | <30 days |
| Strict | >60 days | — | <60 days |

### Rationale
For a 7-day-out decision window, Airbnb Flexible/Moderate or VRBO Relaxed policies provide full refunds. Strict policies require 14+ day notice for any refund — incompatible with a weather-based trigger at 7 days out. The playbook should flag which policy tier the group's actual booking uses.

## Section 4: Rental Car Cancellation Policies

### Decision
Recommend "Pay Later" (non-prepaid) rental car reservations for both destinations.

### Findings

| Strategy | Cancel Fee | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Pay Later (flexible) | Free until pickup | Slightly higher daily rate; maximum flexibility |
| Prepaid | $50-150 depending on timing | Lower rate but costly to cancel |

All major agencies (Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, Budget) offer free cancellation on Pay Later reservations.

### Rationale
Since the destination decision may happen 1-7 days before the trip, prepaid rental cars create unnecessary financial risk. The small premium for Pay Later rates is worth the cancellation flexibility.

## Section 5: Decision Window Structure

### Decision
Use three decision windows: 7-day, 3-day, and 1-day before trip start (Feb 14). These align with weather forecast reliability and booking flexibility.

### Findings

| Window | Date | Forecast Reliability | Booking Flexibility | Decision Type |
|--------|------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 7-day | Feb 7 | Low (general trends only) | High (most bookings changeable) | Preliminary — start watching |
| 3-day | Feb 11 | Moderate (pattern confidence) | Medium (flights may lock, lodging depends on policy) | Firm — make the call |
| 1-day | Feb 13 | High (detailed hour-by-hour) | Low (sunk costs likely) | Final — confirm or emergency pivot |

Weather forecast accuracy degrades significantly beyond 5 days. The 7-day window is for awareness and preparation (book backup lodging if flexible). The 3-day window is the critical decision point where forecasts are reliable enough to act and bookings are still changeable with flexible policies.

### Rationale
Three windows provide sufficient granularity without over-engineering. Morning-of decisions during the trip are already covered by Feature 004's Daily Decision Framework.
