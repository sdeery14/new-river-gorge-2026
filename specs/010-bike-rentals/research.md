# Research: Bike Rentals

**ACE Adventure Resort**:

**Shops NOT offering bike rental**:
- **Water Stone Outdoors** (Fayetteville): Confirmed climbing-gear rental only (crash pads, shoes, guidebooks). Does NOT rent bikes. Phone: (304) 574-2425.
- **Ridge Rider MTB**: Could not locate as an established business. Search results show only a WV youth MTB team and an e-bike model name. May be inactive, renamed, or informal. Removed from guide.

### Rationale
New River Bikes and Arrowhead Bike Farm are the two most reliable local options. ACE is a good third option as a larger resort operation. Adventures on the Gorge is included only as an e-bike alternative. The February warning remains critical — even "open" shops may have reduced hours or limited inventory.

## Section 2: Out-of-Town Alternatives

### Decision
Document 2 out-of-town alternatives within reasonable driving distance (~1.5-2 hours) for when local shops are closed.

### Findings

**Blackwater Bikes** (Davis, WV):
- Location: 685 William Ave., Davis, WV 26260
- Phone: (304) 259-5286
- Website: blackwaterbikes.com
- Hours: Mon/Thu-Sat 10a-5/6p, Tue-Wed Closed, Sun 10a-4p [UNVERIFIED]
- Distance from Fayetteville: ~1.5 hours [UNVERIFIED]
- Pricing: Hardtail alloy $50/day, Full suspension alloy $80/day, Full suspension carbon $120/day, E-bikes $80-120/day [UNVERIFIED]
- Good selection of bike types and sizes
- February status: Open (posted hours) [UNVERIFIED]

**Free Spirit Adventures** (Caldwell, WV):
- Location: 135 Bicycle Ln., Caldwell, WV 24901
- Phone: (304) 536-0333
- Website: freespiritadventures.com
- Distance from Fayetteville: ~1.5 hours [UNVERIFIED]
- Services: Bike rentals, repairs, shuttle service (up to 75 miles)
- Includes helmet and water bottle with rental [UNVERIFIED]
- Trail access: Greenbrier River Trail (78 miles) — not MTB trails
- February status: Unknown [UNVERIFIED]

### Rationale
Blackwater Bikes is the stronger out-of-town option — dedicated MTB shop with clear pricing and good inventory. Free Spirit Adventures is a secondary backup, though oriented more toward Greenbrier River Trail (paved/gravel) than MTB trails. Both require ~1.5-hour drive, making them "rent the day before, bring the bike" options rather than same-day solutions.

## Section 3: Beginner Bike Type & Sizing

### Decision
Recommend hardtail mountain bikes for beginners on green/blue NRG trails. Provide simple height-to-size table.

### Findings

**Bike Type Recommendation**:
- Hardtail recommended for beginners: lighter, cheaper to rent, lower maintenance, teaches proper line selection
- Full-suspension is more comfortable but higher cost and not needed for green/blue trails
- Do NOT rent: road bikes (no traction on dirt), hybrids (not designed for off-road), cruisers (too heavy, no suspension)

**Sizing Table**:

| Frame Size | Height Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| Small (S) | 5'0"–5'4" |
| Medium (M) | 5'4"–5'8" |
| Large (L) | 5'8"–6'0" |
| X-Large (XL) | 6'0"+ |

Key: Standover height (clearance between rider and top tube) matters more than frame size. Want 1+ inch clearance. Shop staff will fit you.

### Rationale
Hardtail is the practical choice for first-time renters on moderate NRG trails in February conditions. Simpler bike = less to go wrong in cold/wet conditions.

## Section 4: Essential Gear & February Riding Tips

### Decision
Provide a gear checklist (what's included vs. bring-your-own) and February-specific riding guidance including freeze-thaw awareness.

### Findings

**Typically Included with Rental**:
- Mountain bike (hardtail, fitted to rider)
- Helmet

**Bring Yourself**:
- Full-fingered gloves (grip, warmth, fall protection)
- Appropriate shoes (stiff-soled, flat-pedal compatible — not soft sneakers)
- Layers: base layer (wicking), mid layer (insulating), wind/water shell
- Wool or synthetic socks (not cotton)
- Water bottle and snacks

**February Riding Conditions (30-45°F)**:
- Dress to dump heat when pedaling, trap heat when coasting — layering essential
- Lower tire pressure for better traction on cold/wet ground
- Cold air reduces tire pressure — check before each ride
- Freeze-thaw cycle is the biggest concern:
  - Ground frozen at dawn, soft/muddy by midday, refrozen by evening
  - DO NOT ride muddy trails — damages trail surface
  - Best window: early morning on frozen ground, or after several dry days
- Cross-reference conditions guide (Feature 004) for daily weather decisions

**Typical Rental Process**:
- Reservation recommended (provide height, weight, ability)
- Bring: government photo ID + credit card
- Sign liability waiver (required)
- Allow ~30 minutes for fitting and orientation
- Half-day (3-4 hrs) or full-day (8 hrs) options typical

### Rationale
February riding at NRG is viable but requires awareness of freeze-thaw conditions. The gear checklist and February tips ensure a beginner shows up prepared rather than discovering cold-weather riding requirements on the trail.

## Section 5: Bring Your Own Bike Strategy

### Decision
Document transport logistics for bringing personal bikes to the trip, as the most reliable February strategy.

### Findings

**Transport Options**:
- Hitch-mount bike rack: Most common for driving groups (2-4 bike capacity)
- Roof rack: Works but adds vehicle height — watch for clearance at gas stations, drive-throughs
- Trunk rack: Budget option, limited to 2-3 bikes, less secure
- Inside vehicle: SUV/truck bed with wheel-off — most weather-protected option for February

**Logistics for the Group**:
- If flying: Bike shipping services (BikeFlights, ShipBikes) or airline bike bags ($35-75 each way) [UNVERIFIED]
- If driving: Bike rack on rental car — confirm rack compatibility with rental agency
- Bike rack rentals: New River Bikes offers car rack rentals [UNVERIFIED]

**Advantages over Renting**:
- Guaranteed availability (no February closure risk)
- Ride your own fitted bike
- No return deadlines

**Disadvantages**:
- Transport logistics and cost
- Risk of damage in transit
- Need to plan ahead for rack/shipping

### Rationale
Given the high risk of February rental closures, bring-your-own is the most reliable strategy. The guide should present this as the primary recommendation with rental as a backup, not the other way around.
