## CRITICAL: PUBLIC ACCESS STATUS

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDING IN THIS DOCUMENT.**

Summit Bechtel Reserve (also called "The Summit") is a **Boy Scouts of America (BSA) facility**. It is NOT a public park, NOT a national forest, and NOT a state recreation area. Public access for mountain biking has a complicated history:

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Is Summit Bechtel Reserve a public facility? | **No** — it is a private BSA facility | High |
| Is public mountain biking access available? | **Yes, with restrictions** — The Summit opened trails to public mountain biking, but access terms have changed over time | [UNVERIFIED — status as of May 2025 training data; MUST be re-confirmed for February 2026] |
| Is registration/waiver required? | **Yes** — BSA requires at minimum a signed liability waiver for non-BSA visitors | [UNVERIFIED] |
| Is there a fee for public mountain biking? | **Likely yes** — day-use fees or annual passes have been reported | [UNVERIFIED] |
| Is winter (February) access available? | **UNCERTAIN** — The Summit's primary season aligns with BSA Jamboree and summer camp operations. Winter public access may be limited, reduced, or unavailable. | [UNVERIFIED — THIS IS THE HIGHEST-PRIORITY ITEM TO VERIFY] |

### Public Access History

- **2013**: Summit Bechtel Reserve opened as the permanent home of the BSA National Scout Jamboree, replacing Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. The facility was built with significant mountain biking infrastructure, including a purpose-built trail network designed by IMBA Trail Solutions. [UNVERIFIED]
- **2013-2019**: The facility was primarily used for BSA events (National Jamboree every 4 years, plus year-round Scouting programs). Public access to the trail system was limited and inconsistent. [UNVERIFIED]
- **~2017-2019**: The Summit began allowing limited public mountain biking access, typically requiring registration, a waiver, and potentially a fee. This was part of an effort to make the facility a year-round recreation destination beyond BSA events. [UNVERIFIED]
- **2019-2020**: BSA filed for bankruptcy (February 2020). This significantly impacted Summit Bechtel Reserve operations and may have affected public access programs. [High confidence on bankruptcy filing; UNVERIFIED on specific impact to public access]
- **2021-2023**: Post-bankruptcy, BSA restructured. The Summit continued to host Jamboree events (2023 National Jamboree was held there). Public access programs may have changed during this period. [UNVERIFIED]
- **2024-2025**: Current public access status is unclear from training data. The facility may have expanded, reduced, or suspended public mountain biking access. [UNVERIFIED]

### ACTION REQUIRED BEFORE TRIP PLANNING

**The following must be verified before including Summit Bechtel Reserve in any trip plan:**

1. **Call The Summit directly**: (304) 465-2800 or check summitbsa.org [UNVERIFIED — verify current phone number]
2. **Check if public day-use mountain biking is offered in February 2026**
3. **Check if the facility is open to non-BSA members at all in winter**
4. **Check current fee structure and waiver requirements**
5. **Check if trails are maintained/open during winter months**
6. **Check Trailforks (trailforks.com) for current trail status and public access notes**
7. **Check local bike shops in Fayetteville** (New River Bikes, Arrowhead Bike Farm) for current access intel

## 2. Trail System Overview

### Trail Network Summary

| Attribute | Value | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Total trail mileage** | ~30-40 miles of mountain bike trails | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Number of individual trails** | ~15-25 named trails | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Difficulty range** | Green Circle through Double Black Diamond | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Trail designer** | IMBA Trail Solutions (International Mountain Bicycling Association) | [UNVERIFIED — widely reported] |
| **Trail builder** | IMBA Trail Solutions, with BSA volunteer labor | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Trail maintainer** | BSA / Summit Bechtel Reserve staff | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Trail style** | Purpose-built singletrack; flow trails, cross-country, skills features, pump track | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Shuttle/lift** | No chairlift. Some trails may be designed for shuttle-assisted riding via Summit roads. | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Pump track** | Yes — a pump track facility exists at The Summit | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Skills park / features** | Yes — a mountain bike skills area with progressive features was built for Jamboree programs | [UNVERIFIED] |

### Trail Network Design Philosophy

The Summit Bechtel Reserve trail system was purpose-built by IMBA Trail Solutions as part of the facility's adventure sports infrastructure. Unlike organic trail networks that evolve over decades, The Summit's trails were designed from scratch with:

- Progressive difficulty (green to double-black)
- Sustainable trail construction techniques (IMBA standards)
- Connectivity between adventure program areas
- Capacity for large groups (Jamboree events)
- Skills development progression for beginners through advanced riders

This makes it notably different from most Appalachian singletrack networks — it's more similar to a bike park or purpose-built trail center. [UNVERIFIED]

### Trail Network Layout

The trail system is generally organized on the ridges and hollows of the Appalachian Plateau terrain within The Summit property. The topography includes:

- Ridge-top trails with moderate grades
- Hollow/drainage descents with more technical terrain
- Connector trails linking various program areas within the facility
- Some trails following old logging roads or mining access roads

[UNVERIFIED — layout description is inferred from terrain and IMBA design principles, not from a verified trail map]

### Trailforks Data

The Summit Bechtel Reserve trails are listed on Trailforks under the region name "The Summit Bechtel Reserve" or similar. Trailforks is the best source for:
- Current trail status (open/closed)
- Trail conditions (user reports)
- GPS tracks and trail maps
- Individual trail details (distance, elevation, difficulty)

**Trailforks URL**: https://www.trailforks.com/region/the-summit-bechtel-reserve/ [UNVERIFIED — URL may differ; search "Summit Bechtel Reserve" on Trailforks]

## 4. February Conditions

### Winter Weather at The Summit

| Condition | February Typical | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Average high temp** | 40-45 F | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Average low temp** | 20-25 F | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Freeze/thaw cycles** | Frequent — daytime thaw, overnight refreeze common | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Snow** | Possible; average February snowfall ~5-10 inches for the region | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Rain** | Possible; February is not the wettest month but precipitation events occur | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Mud risk** | **HIGH** — freeze/thaw cycles create significant mud on dirt trails, especially machine-built flow trails without rock armoring | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Ice risk** | **MODERATE-HIGH** — shaded north-facing trails and any trail with water crossings or seeps can ice up and remain icy for days in February | [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Daylight** | ~10.5-11 hours; sunrise ~7:15 AM, sunset ~6:00 PM | [UNVERIFIED] |

### Trail Condition Expectations for February

| Trail Type | Expected February Condition | Ridability |
|------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Machine-built flow trails | Soft/muddy during thaw; frozen and rideable (but hard) in morning freeze; potentially icy in shaded sections | Poor to Fair — riding muddy machine-built trails causes significant damage |
| Fire road / connectors | Generally rideable; gravel surface handles wet/freeze better than dirt singletrack | Fair to Good |
| Rocky singletrack (XC) | Better than flow trails in wet conditions; rock surface drains faster and handles freeze/thaw better | Fair |
| Pump track / skills area | Depends on drainage; paved/hardened surfaces rideable; dirt pump track may be muddy | Variable |

### Key February Risk: Trail Damage from Winter Riding

**Riding wet, muddy dirt trails causes lasting damage to trail tread.** IMBA and most trail management organizations recommend NOT riding machine-built singletrack when trails are muddy. The Summit's trails, being machine-built by IMBA Trail Solutions, are particularly susceptible to:

- Rut formation in soft, thawed dirt
- Berm erosion when wet
- Widening of trail tread as riders avoid muddy center line

**Even if The Summit is technically open in February, trail stewards and the mountain biking community may strongly discourage riding if trails are muddy.** Check trail condition reports before riding.

### Seasonal Closure Possibility

**CRITICAL**: Many trail systems in the mid-Atlantic and Appalachian region implement seasonal mud-season closures, typically from late November through mid-April (or until trails dry). The Summit may close trails entirely during winter months to prevent trail damage.

**Verify with The Summit whether trails are open in February before planning to ride there.**

## 5. Public Access Policy — Detailed Analysis

### BSA Facility Access Framework

Summit Bechtel Reserve is fundamentally a **private facility** owned and operated by the Boy Scouts of America. Understanding access requires understanding the BSA's approach to facility use:

| Access Category | Description | Applies to Our Group? |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **BSA Jamboree events** | National and regional Jamboree events. Primary purpose of the facility. | No |
| **BSA unit camping / programs** | Registered Scout troops and crews using the facility for camping and adventure programs year-round | No |
| **BSA council events** | Regional BSA council events, trainings, and gatherings | No |
| **Public day-use recreation** | Non-BSA visitors accessing specific activities (mountain biking, zip-lining, climbing, etc.) for a fee | **This is our category** |
| **Special events** | Organized races, festivals, or community events hosted at The Summit | Possibly, if a winter event coincides with our dates |

### What "Public Access" Means at The Summit

When sources describe The Summit as having "public access" for mountain biking, this typically means:

1. **Not walk-up access** — You cannot simply drive onto the property and start riding like you would at a public trail system. [UNVERIFIED]
2. **Registration required** — Visitors must register, typically at a check-in point or online in advance. [UNVERIFIED]
3. **Liability waiver required** — BSA requires a signed waiver for all visitors. [UNVERIFIED]
4. **Fee required** — Day-use fees have been reported. Amount unclear from training data. [UNVERIFIED]
5. **Hours restricted** — Public access is typically during specific hours, not dawn-to-dusk like a public park. [UNVERIFIED]
6. **Seasonal availability** — Public recreation programs may operate primarily during warmer months (April-October or similar). [UNVERIFIED]
7. **Activity-specific** — Access may be granted for specific activities (mountain biking, zip-lining) but not general property exploration. [UNVERIFIED]

### Has Public Access Changed Recently?

The BSA's financial restructuring (2020 bankruptcy filing, emergence from bankruptcy ~2023) may have significantly impacted Summit Bechtel Reserve operations:

- **Reduced staffing** may mean fewer public programs [UNVERIFIED]
- **Revenue generation pressure** may mean more public access to generate income [UNVERIFIED]
- **Property disposition concerns** — there were discussions about whether BSA would retain all its properties post-bankruptcy. The Summit appears to have been retained. [UNVERIFIED]

**Bottom line: Public mountain biking access status at The Summit as of February 2026 CANNOT be determined from training data alone. Direct verification is required.**

### Verification Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Call The Summit**: (304) 465-2800 [UNVERIFIED — verify current number]
   - Ask: "Is public mountain biking available in February 2026?"
   - Ask: "What are the hours, fees, and registration requirements?"
   - Ask: "Are trails open and maintained in winter?"
2. **Check summitbsa.org**: Look for "Public Access," "Day Use," "Mountain Biking," or "Adventures" pages
3. **Check Trailforks**: Trail status and user-submitted condition reports may indicate whether people are riding there in winter
4. **Check Strava**: Search for recent Strava activities at The Summit to see if anyone has ridden there recently in winter months
5. **Ask local bike shops**: New River Bikes in Fayetteville, Arrowhead Bike Farm — they will know current access status
6. **Check social media**: The Summit's Facebook/Instagram pages; search "Summit Bechtel mountain biking"

## Web Access Limitation Notice

**This research session was unable to perform live web lookups.** Both WebSearch and WebFetch tools were denied. All data in this document comes from the model's training data (cutoff May 2025) and general knowledge of:

- BSA Summit Bechtel Reserve as a facility
- IMBA Trail Solutions design practices
- Appalachian mountain biking conditions
- BSA access policies and post-bankruptcy operations
- General WV winter weather patterns

**This data has NOT been cross-referenced against live websites, apps, or phone calls.** The confidence level for Summit Bechtel Reserve data is LOWER than the bouldering area research (Feature 001) because:

1. Summit is a private facility with changeable access policies (vs. NPS/public land)
2. The trail system is less widely documented on public platforms than popular public trail systems
3. Winter access is particularly uncertain for a facility whose primary season is summer
4. BSA's financial restructuring may have changed operations

**Before writing the Summit Bechtel Reserve trail profile document, ALL Priority 1 data gaps (Section 9) must be resolved through manual verification.**
