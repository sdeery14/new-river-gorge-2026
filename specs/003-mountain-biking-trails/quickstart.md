**Feature**: 003-mountain-biking-trails

## Workflow 1: Morning Trail Selection (US1)

**Scenario**: It's 7 AM. The group wants to ride today. Which trail system?

1. Open `trails/README.md` on phone
2. Check summary table — scan February viability column
3. Match conditions to Quick Decision Guide:
   - Frozen ground + dry → Arrowhead (5-10 min) or Summit Bechtel if accessible (12-18 min)
   - Wet/muddy → Skip riding, go boulder instead
   - Short session → Arrowhead (closest)
4. Tap trail system link for full details
5. Check condition source (Trailforks app or call local shop) morning-of
6. Go ride

**Success**: Rider identifies a trail system and makes a go/no-go decision in under 30 seconds.

## Workflow 2: Ride + Boulder Day Plan (US2)

**Scenario**: Half the group wants to ride in the morning, then everyone boulders in the afternoon.

1. Open `trails/README.md` → Bouldering-Area Pairings section
2. Find a pairing that minimizes driving:
   - Arrowhead AM → Gorge Boulders PM (10-15 min between, ~25-40 min total driving)
   - Summit Bechtel AM → Gorge Boulders PM (15-20 min between)
3. Check weather scenario column for current conditions
4. Riders leave at 8 AM, ride 2-3 hours, drive to bouldering area by noon
5. Boulderers can go directly to the bouldering area and start climbing
6. Groups reconvene at bouldering area for afternoon session

**Success**: Group builds a complete day plan in under 60 seconds.

## Workflow 3: Rain-Day Pivot (US2 variant)

**Scenario**: Forecast shows rain in the morning clearing by 2 PM.

1. Morning: Ride Arrowhead on packed/frozen trails if conditions allow (rain on frozen ground is rideable)
2. OR: Skip riding, go to sheltered bouldering (Gorge Boulders — Endless Wall cliff-base overhangs)
3. Afternoon: After rain clears, switch to bouldering at area with fast-drying overhangs
4. Consult `areas/sheltered-classics.md` for rain-day bouldering options

**Success**: Group has a plan for both halves of the day despite weather.

## Workflow 4: Bike Rental (US3)

**Scenario**: A group member arrives without a bike and wants to ride.

1. Open `trails/README.md` → Bike Rentals section
2. Check February availability column — identify open shops
3. Call ahead (phone number in table) to confirm availability and reserve
4. Note bike type and whether it's suitable for the planned trail
5. Pick up bike, ride

**February contingency**: If no rental shops are open, options are:
- Borrow a bike from another group member (if anyone brought a spare)
- Rent from a shop in a larger town (Charleston, Beckley) en route
- Skip riding for the day

**Success**: Rider finds rental info in under 30 seconds and can make arrangements.

## Workflow 5: Pre-Trip Verification

**Scenario**: One week before the trip, verify all mountain biking plans.

1. Call Summit Bechtel Reserve: (304) 465-2800 — confirm public MTB access in February
2. Call Ridge Rider: confirm February hours and bike rental availability
3. Call Babcock State Park: (304) 438-3004 — confirm winter road access
4. Check Trailforks app for Arrowhead Trails current condition reports
5. Check Active SWV Facebook for any winter closure announcements
6. Update trip plans based on findings

**Success**: All uncertainty items resolved before departure.

## Edge Case: All Trails Unrideable

**Scenario**: February weather makes all trails too muddy/icy to ride responsibly.

1. Check `trails/README.md` February conditions — all systems show Poor or Uncertain
2. Pivot to all-bouldering day plan using `areas/README.md`
3. Consider rest-day alternatives (hiking, sightseeing, town day)
4. Check trail conditions again the next morning — conditions can change overnight with a freeze

**This is expected in February.** The trip documentation should make it clear that mountain biking in mid-February WV is opportunistic, not guaranteed.
