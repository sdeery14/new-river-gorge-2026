## Trail Systems Identified

### 1. Arrowhead Trails (PRIMARY)

**Decision**: Include as primary trail system. Closest to Fayetteville, purpose-built MTB, free access.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Outskirts of Fayetteville, near Gatewood Rd / Arrowhead Dr |
| GPS | ~38.05 N, -81.10 W [UNVERIFIED] |
| Drive from Fayetteville | ~5-10 min |
| Total mileage | ~10-13 mi singletrack [UNVERIFIED] — system was actively expanding through 2024-2025 |
| Trail count | ~8-12 named trails/segments [UNVERIFIED] |
| Difficulty range | Green Circle through Black Diamond (IMBA) |
| Trail style | Cross-country, flow trail, stacked loop design |
| Surface | Dirt singletrack, rocky/rooty Appalachian terrain |
| Builder/maintainer | Active Southern West Virginia (Active SWV) |
| Land | Mix of private and public; access facilitated by Active SWV |
| Fees | Free [UNVERIFIED] |
| Condition sources | Trailforks, MTB Project, Active SWV Facebook, Water Stone Outdoors (304) 574-2425 |

**February Conditions**:
- **Freeze/thaw**: Primary concern. Frozen ground in morning, softening midday on sunny days above 32F
- **Mud risk**: HIGH. Appalachian dirt singletrack at peak mud vulnerability in February
- **Ice risk**: Moderate. Shaded sections can hold ice for days
- **Snow**: Common in Fayette County in February
- **Closures**: No formal seasonal closure documented; community ethic is stay off when soft
- **Best February days**: After 2-3 dry days with temps below freezing; early morning on frozen ground
- **Overall February viability**: MODERATE — conditionally rideable, check morning-of

**Individual trails**: Per-trail inventory NOT available from training data. Trailforks is the primary source for trail names, distances, elevation, and difficulty per segment.

**Rationale**: Closest system, reliably public, free, purpose-built for MTB, adequate difficulty range. Default recommendation for any riding day.

### 2. Summit Bechtel Reserve (CONDITIONAL)

**Decision**: Include as conditional/bonus option. Outstanding trail system IF accessible — but private facility with uncertain winter public access.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | 2550 Jack Furst Dr, Glen Jean, WV 25846 [UNVERIFIED] |
| GPS | ~38.02 N, -81.11 W [UNVERIFIED] |
| Drive from Fayetteville | ~12-18 min |
| Total mileage | ~30-40 mi [UNVERIFIED] |
| Trail count | ~15-25 named trails [UNVERIFIED] |
| Difficulty range | Green Circle through Double Black Diamond |
| Trail style | Purpose-built: flow trails, XC, skills features, pump track |
| Surface | Machine-built dirt singletrack, gravel fire roads, natural surface |
| Builder/maintainer | IMBA Trail Solutions / BSA |
| Land | Boy Scouts of America — PRIVATE FACILITY |
| Fees | Likely $5-20/day, waiver required [UNVERIFIED] |
| Contact | (304) 465-2800 [UNVERIFIED], summitbsa.org |
| Condition sources | Trailforks, MTB Project, Summit BSA website/social media |

**PUBLIC ACCESS — CRITICAL UNCERTAINTY**:
- Public MTB access existed in some form (~2017-2019 onward), requiring registration, waiver, fee
- Primary season aligns with BSA summer programs; winter access may be unavailable
- BSA filed for bankruptcy Feb 2020, emerged ~2023 — impact on public access programs unknown
- **MUST verify by phone before trip**: Call (304) 465-2800 or check summitbsa.org

**February Conditions**:
- Freeze/thaw: Frequent — machine-built dirt trails are especially vulnerable
- Mud risk: HIGH — riding wet flow trails causes lasting damage
- Ice risk: MODERATE-HIGH on shaded north-facing trails
- Possible seasonal closure: Many Appalachian systems close Nov-April for trail protection
- **Overall February viability**: UNCERTAIN — contingent on access + conditions

**Rationale**: By far the best trail system in the area by mileage and design quality. But private ownership and uncertain winter access make it unreliable for trip planning. Profile it honestly — could be the highlight of the trip or completely unavailable.

**Alternatives considered**: Including Summit as primary system — rejected because access cannot be guaranteed.

### 3. Babcock State Park (SUPPLEMENTARY)

**Decision**: Include as supplementary/light ride option. Not a destination MTB system but pairs with scenic sightseeing.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | 486 Babcock Rd, Clifftop, WV 25831 [UNVERIFIED] |
| GPS | ~38.02 N, -80.95 W [UNVERIFIED] |
| Drive from Fayetteville | ~30-35 min |
| Total MTB-suitable mileage | ~5-10 mi (old roads/railroad grades ONLY) [UNVERIFIED] |
| Trail count | ~3-5 bike-suitable routes [UNVERIFIED] |
| Difficulty range | Green Circle through Blue Square |
| Trail style | Old roads, railroad grades, doubletrack — NOT purpose-built MTB singletrack |
| Surface | Gravel/dirt road, packed dirt railroad grade |
| Land | WV Division of Natural Resources (State Parks) |
| Fees | Free (no entrance fee) [UNVERIFIED] |
| Contact | (304) 438-3004 [UNVERIFIED], wvstateparks.com |
| Condition sources | WV State Parks website, Babcock phone, AllTrails |

**Mountain biking limitations**:
- Bikes NOT permitted on all trails — only on designated trails, old roads, and service roads
- Hiking-only footpaths (Glade Creek Trail, Island in the Sky, etc.) are closed to bikes
- Not listed on Trailforks/MTB Project or has minimal coverage

**Potentially bike-legal routes** [ALL UNVERIFIED]:
- Old Sewell Road: ~2-3 mi, Green Circle, gravel/dirt road
- Narrow Gauge Trail: ~3-4 mi, Green Circle, old railroad grade (may not exist or may not allow bikes)
- Park service roads: Various distances, gravel

**February Conditions**:
- Park land accessible year-round, but facilities (cabins, restaurant) closed seasonally
- Interior park roads MAY be gated or unplowed in winter — call to verify
- Elevation ~2,000-2,500 ft — colder than Fayetteville, more snow/ice
- Mud risk: HIGH. Freeze/thaw: active. Ice risk: MODERATE-HIGH
- Hunting: WV late seasons may extend into early-mid February — blaze orange advisable
- **Overall February viability**: LOW-MODERATE — "check that morning" situation

**Rationale**: Position as half-day scenic side trip, not primary riding day. Pairs well with visiting Glade Creek Grist Mill. Old road surfaces handle freeze/thaw better than singletrack.

**Alternatives considered**: Excluding entirely — rejected because it's within scope and offers a different experience (scenic state park vs. trail system).

### 4. Camp Creek State Forest (BORDERLINE)

**Decision**: Mention in overview as a fourth option at the edge of scope. Do not create a full profile.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Near Princeton, WV (Exit 20 off I-77) |
| Drive from Fayetteville | ~45-50 min |
| MTB mileage | ~10-15 mi (logging roads + singletrack) [UNVERIFIED] |
| Difficulty | Easy to moderate, XC style |
| Land | WV Division of Natural Resources |
| February viability | LOW-MODERATE (muddy, icy) |

**Rationale**: At the outer edge of the 45-minute radius. Not destination-quality. Mentioned for completeness but does not warrant a full profile.

---

### 5. Systems Investigated and Excluded

| System | Status | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Long Point Trail / NRG South Rim | NO MTB | NPS National Park — hiking only |
| Grandview Area | NO MTB | NPS land, hiking only, may be gated in winter |
| Burnwood Area | UNCLEAR | NPS boundary, legal status unclear |
| Pluto/Mars Area | NO DATA | No documented MTB system |
| Gauley River NRA | NO DATA | NPS-managed, no confirmed MTB trails |
| NRG Railroad Grades | UNCLEAR | Old corridors, MTB legality unclear under NPS |
| ACE Adventure Resort | SEASONAL | May overlap with Arrowhead; not available in February |
| Adventures on the Gorge | NO DATA | Primarily rafting/zip-line; no confirmed MTB system |
| Monongahela National Forest | TOO FAR | ~90 min north |
| Kanawha State Forest | TOO FAR | ~60-70 min north |

**Key constraint**: The 2020 NRG National Park redesignation prohibits mountain biking on park trails unless specifically authorized. This severely limits MTB options near Fayetteville.

## Bike Rental Shops

### Ridge Rider Mountain Bikes (BEST OPTION)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Fayetteville, WV (downtown area) [UNVERIFIED exact address] |
| Phone/website | [UNVERIFIED — search ridgeridermtb.com or Facebook] |
| What they offer | MTB rental and guide service, associated with Arrowhead Trails |
| Bike types | Likely hardtail and possibly full suspension [UNVERIFIED] |
| Pricing | Est. $40-75/day hardtail, $60-100+/day full suspension [UNVERIFIED] |
| February availability | UNKNOWN — seasonal business, may be closed |
| Reservations | Likely recommended; essential in February if open |

### ACE Adventure Resort

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | 1 Concho Rd, Oak Hill, WV 25901 (~15 min from Fayetteville) |
| Phone | (800) 787-3982 |
| Website | aceraft.com |
| What they offer | Guided MTB tours and bike rentals (seasonal) |
| Bike types | Basic to mid-range hardtails [UNVERIFIED] |
| February availability | Very unlikely — adventure activities are seasonal (April/May-October) |

### Adventures on the Gorge

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | 219 Chestnutburg Rd, Lansing, WV 25862 (~5-10 min from Fayetteville) |
| Phone | (855) 379-8738 |
| Website | adventuresonthegorge.com |
| February availability | Very unlikely for bike rentals |

### New River Bikes

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Fayetteville area (possibly Hico/Lookout) [UNVERIFIED] |
| February availability | [UNVERIFIED] — same seasonal concerns as other shops |

### February Rental Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK that no bike rental shop will be open in mid-February.** Fayetteville (pop. ~2,800) has an overwhelmingly seasonal outdoor economy (May-October). Ridge Rider is the most likely candidate for winter availability but this is unverified.

**Contingency options**:
1. Bring your own bikes
2. Rent from a shop in Charleston or Beckley before driving to Fayetteville
3. Contact Ridge Rider in advance to arrange special-request February rental
4. Check if any Beckley shops (~30 min south, larger town) offer rentals

## Design Decisions

### D1: Trail System Tier Structure

**Decision**: Three tiers for trail systems:
- **Primary**: Arrowhead Trails (default recommendation)
- **Conditional**: Summit Bechtel Reserve (profile fully, but flag access uncertainty)
- **Supplementary**: Babcock State Park (light ride / scenic option)

**Rationale**: Honest tiering prevents the group from planning around an inaccessible system while still documenting the full range of options.

### D2: February Viability Rating Scale

**Decision**: Use a 4-level scale matching the bouldering rain resilience pattern:
- **Good**: Reliably rideable most February days with appropriate timing
- **Fair**: Rideable on good days, check conditions morning-of
- **Poor**: Rarely rideable in February, high risk of closures/damage
- **Uncertain**: Access or conditions cannot be confirmed — verify before trip

**Rationale**: Consistent with the bouldering area ratings. "Uncertain" is new — needed for Summit Bechtel where the issue is access, not just conditions.

### D3: Bike Rental Section Placement

**Decision**: Include rental info in `trails/README.md` overview rather than a separate file. The data is small (3-4 shops) and belongs in the decision-making flow.

**Rationale**: A separate file would be overkill for 3-4 shop entries. Riders deciding whether to ride need rental info alongside trail options.

### D4: Bouldering Pairing Section Placement

**Decision**: Include pairings in `trails/README.md` as a dedicated section, not a separate file.

**Rationale**: Pairings are a planning tool that belongs alongside the trail overview. Creating a separate file fragments the decision flow.

### D5: IMBA Difficulty Notation

**Decision**: Use text labels with emoji shorthand: `🟢 Green`, `🔵 Blue`, `⬛ Black`, `⬛⬛ Double Black`. Fall back to text-only if emoji rendering is inconsistent.

**Rationale**: IMBA icons are universally recognized by mountain bikers. Text labels ensure accessibility when emoji don't render.

**Alternative considered**: Color words only ("Green Circle", "Blue Square") — rejected as less scannable.
