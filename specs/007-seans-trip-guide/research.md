**Feature**: 007-seans-trip-guide | **Date**: 2026-02-11

## Section 1: V1-V3 Problem Inventory

### Summary

27 named V0-V3 problems documented across 3 bouldering areas, with 7 designated classics. This provides sufficient content for a curated beginner hit list at each area.

### Meadow River — 6 Named V0-V3 Problems (2 Classics)

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| The Warm-Up | V1 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | Flat | ⭐ |
| Easy Overhang | V0 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | Flat | |
| River Slab | V2 | Slab | Exposed | Flat | |
| Meadow Mantle | V3 | Mantle / vertical | Exposed | Flat | |
| Juggy Roof | V2 | Roof / jug | Sheltered | Flat | ⭐ |
| Beginner Traverse | V1 | Traverse | Exposed | Flat | |

**Beginner assessment**: Good area for beginners. Flat landings, short roadside approaches, 50% sheltered problems. The Warm-Up (V1) is the obvious first climb of any session.

**Rain-day beginner options**: 3 sheltered problems (The Warm-Up, Easy Overhang, Juggy Roof).

### Summersville Lake — 13 Named V0-V3 Problems (4 Classics)

**Long Point Sector (9 problems)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Long Point Warm-Up | V0 | Slab / jug | Exposed | Flat | ⭐ |
| Lakeshore Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Flat | ⭐ |
| Easy Traverse | V1 | Traverse | Exposed | Flat | ⭐ |
| Beginner's Luck | V2 | Vertical face / jug | Exposed | Flat | |
| The Ramp | V0 | Slab / easy | Exposed | Flat | |
| Sandy Mantle | V3 | Mantle | Exposed | Flat | |
| Short Stack | V2 | Vertical face | Exposed | Flat | |
| Lakeside Steps | V3 | Vertical / steps | Exposed | Flat | |
| Drawdown Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Flat | |

**Pirates Cove Sector (2 problems)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Pirate Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Flat | |
| Cove Jug Haul | V0 | Overhang / jug | Partial | Flat | |

**Other Sectors (2 problems)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| The Platform | V2 | Slab / mantle | Exposed | Flat | |
| Sunset Slab | V0 | Slab | Exposed | Flat | ⭐ |

**Beginner assessment**: Best beginner area in the region. Highest V0-V3 count, all flat lakebed landings, excellent slab variety for developing footwork. February drawdown (~77 ft) exposes extra problems.

**Rain-day beginner options**: Only Cove Jug Haul (V0) has partial shelter. NOT a rain-day area.

### Gorge Boulders — 8 Named V0-V3 Problems (1 Classic)

**Endless Wall (3 problems)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Gorge Warm-Up | V2 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | Uneven | ⭐ |
| Fern Creek Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Uneven | |
| Easy Wall | V0 | Vertical face | Partial | Uneven | |

**Bridge Buttress (2 problems)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Bridge Slab | V1 | Slab / vertical | Exposed | Uneven | |
| Easy Bridge | V0 | Vertical / jug | Partial | Uneven | |

**Nuttall / Fern Buttress (1 problem)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Fern Slab | V1 | Slab | Partial | Uneven | |

**Kaymoor (2 problems — NOT RECOMMENDED February)**:

| Problem | Grade | Style | Shelter | Landing | Classic |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Kaymoor Jug Haul | V2 | Overhang / jug | Sheltered | Poor | ⚠️ Skip Feb |
| Mine Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Poor | ⚠️ Skip Feb |

**Beginner assessment**: Limited for beginners. Only 6 usable problems in February (excluding Kaymoor). All uneven/talus landings require careful pad placement. Best used as a rain-day backup for experienced climbers, not a primary beginner destination.

**Rain-day beginner options**: Gorge Warm-Up (V2 fully sheltered) is the only fully protected beginner problem. 3 more are partially sheltered.

### Cross-Area Beginner Ranking

| Rank | Area | Named V0-V3 | Classics | Flat Landings | Shelter | Best For |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Summersville Lake | 13 | 4 | All (13) | 1 partial | Sunny dry days, extended sessions, slab progression |
| 2 | Meadow River | 6 | 2 | All (6) | 3 sheltered | Default day, rain backup, quick sessions |
| 3 | Gorge Boulders | 6 usable | 1 | None (all uneven) | 4 sheltered/partial | Rain-day shelter, experienced climbers only |

### Skills Progression Path (V0 → V3)

1. **Start**: Long Point Warm-Up (V0 slab) → The Warm-Up (V1 jug)
2. **Slab**: Lakeshore Slab (V1) → River Slab (V2) → Drawdown Slab (V1)
3. **Traverse**: Easy Traverse (V1) → Beginner Traverse (V1)
4. **Roof/Overhang**: Easy Overhang (V0) → Juggy Roof (V2) → Gorge Warm-Up (V2)
5. **Mantle**: The Platform (V2) → Meadow Mantle (V3) → Sandy Mantle (V3)

## Section 2: Mountain Biking Priority Stack Analysis

### Trail Ranking for Sean

| Rank | Trail System | Drive | Conditions Gate | Access Risk | Best For |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Arrowhead Trails | 5-10 min | Frozen ground (ride before 10 AM) | None — free, always open | Default ride, pairs with afternoon bouldering |
| 2 | Summit Bechtel Reserve | 12-18 min | Any dry day, access confirmed | HIGH — private, must call ahead | Premium trails if accessible (30-40 mi) |
| 3 | Babcock State Park | 30-35 min | Dry roads, park roads open | MEDIUM — roads may be gated | Scenic light ride, railroad grades |

### February Reality Check

- Mountain biking in mid-February WV is opportunistic, not guaranteed
- Best window: frozen ground mornings (7-10 AM) after cold overnight
- Worst case: zero rideable days if extended thaw + rain cycle
- Community ethic: **never ride wet or soft trails** — causes lasting damage
- Sean's fallback: boulder instead. The guide must not make biking feel "wasted" if conditions never align

### Ideal Split-Day Pattern

1. **Early AM (7:00-10:00)**: Ride Arrowhead on frozen ground
2. **Mid-morning**: Return to house, change gear
3. **Afternoon (12:00-4:00)**: Boulder at Gorge Boulders or Meadow River (best friction after thaw)

## Section 4: Document Structure Patterns

### Decision: Hybrid Pattern

Sean's guide uses a hybrid of patterns from Features 004-006:

1. **Decision matrix at top** (from conditions/README.md) — "What should I do today?" table
2. **Curated entries with personal notes** (from rest-day/README.md) — hit list, food picks
3. **Quick-reference tables** (from logistics/README.md) — area rankings, trail stack

### Document Sections (in order)

1. Header with context (second-person voice)
2. Your Daily Decision Matrix (quick-reference table)
3. Your Bouldering Hit List (by area, curated V1-V3 problems)
4. Your Mountain Biking Priority Stack (ranked trails with conditions)
5. Your Food & Drink Picks (curated restaurants/breweries)
6. Your Sample Week (day-by-day itinerary with weather variation)
7. Your Packing Checklist (activity-specific gear)
8. Your Logistics Summary (personal arrival/departure, car, contacts)
9. Footer with sources

### Voice Examples

- "Your best slab day is at Summersville Lake"
- "If it rained overnight, head to Meadow River — your sheltered classics are there"
- "Don't ride Arrowhead after 10 AM if temps hit 35°F — the ground will be soup"
