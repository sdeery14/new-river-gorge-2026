**Feature**: 005-rest-day-pack | **Date**: 2026-02-11

## 1. Dining (Fayetteville + 20-min radius)

## 2. Breweries

### Decision
Include Bridge Brew Works (confirmed operational) and note that "Fayetteville Brewing Co." from the vision.md may refer to The Freefolk Brewery or Southside Junction Tap House — both are Fayetteville-based beer-focused venues. The Freefolk Brewery has a closure flag and requires phone verification.

### Findings

**Bridge Brew Works**
- Location: 335 Nick Rahall Greenway, Fayetteville, WV 25840
- Hours: Conflicting sources — either Wed-Sun 1p-10p OR Fri-Sun 1p-9p [UNVERIFIED]
- Food: Pizza, tacos, food truck on site (check Facebook for food truck schedule)
- Atmosphere: Outdoor patio, tasting room, dog friendly
- Group suitability: Excellent
- Status: Confirmed operational

**The Freefolk Brewery**
- Location: 1690 Court St, Fayetteville, WV 25840
- Hours: Wed-Thu 4p-9p, Fri 4p-10p, Sat 12p-10p, Sun 12p-8p, Mon-Tue closed
- Food: Wood-fired pizza, gyros, fish tacos; locally sourced meats
- Status: **WARNING — Yelp marked "CLOSED" as of Nov 2025. Must call (304) 574-6094 to verify before including in final guide** [UNVERIFIED]

**Southside Junction Tap House** (also listed under Dining)
- Functions as a brewpub with 12 rotating local craft beer taps
- Overlaps with dining category; included in both for discoverability

### Key Finding
The spec references "Fayetteville Brewing Co." — this does not appear to be a currently operating business under that exact name. The two primary brewery-focused venues in Fayetteville are Bridge Brew Works and The Freefolk Brewery. Southside Junction Tap House also serves as a craft beer destination. The spec's FR-004 should be satisfied by Bridge Brew Works + one of the other two venues (pending verification).

- Freefolk Brewery: freefolkbrew.com, Yelp
- Southside Junction: visitfayettevillewv.com

### Unverified Items

- Freefolk Brewery operational status [UNVERIFIED — closure flag]
- Whether "Fayetteville Brewing Co." exists as a separate entity [UNVERIFIED]

## 3. Hot Springs

### Decision
Only The Greenbrier (White Sulphur Springs, WV) falls within the 90-minute drive threshold. Berkeley Springs (~4 hrs) and Omni Homestead (~5.5 hrs) are too far. Document The Greenbrier as the primary option and note the limited availability honestly.

### Findings

**The Greenbrier — White Sulphur Springs, WV**
- Distance from Fayetteville: 62 miles / ~1 hr 32 min drive
- Type: Luxury resort with historic mineral spa
- Treatment: "Greenbrier Treatment" — soak in healing waters, Swiss shower, scotch spray, Swedish massage
- Cost: High-end resort pricing ($$$ — expect $150+ per person for spa treatments) [UNVERIFIED]
- Reservations: Required [UNVERIFIED]
- February availability: Year-round resort, likely open [UNVERIFIED]

**Not viable (too far)**:
- Berkeley Springs State Park: 261 miles / 4 hrs 14 min — exceeds 90-min limit
- Omni Homestead Resort (VA): 264 miles / 5 hrs 35 min — exceeds 90-min limit
- Capon Springs: Distance unconfirmed but likely 3+ hours [UNVERIFIED]

### Key Finding
Hot springs options near Fayetteville are extremely limited. The Greenbrier is the only viable option and is a luxury resort — not a casual hot springs soak. The guide should present this honestly and suggest alternatives for the "soak and relax" impulse (e.g., rental house hot tub if available, or simply noting the limitation).

- distance-cities.com for drive time verification

### Unverified Items
- Greenbrier spa pricing, reservation process, February availability [UNVERIFIED]
- Whether any closer natural hot springs or soaking options exist [UNVERIFIED]

## 5. Indoor Activities

### Findings

| Name | Type | Location | Drive Time | Notes |

## Summary of Key Decisions

| Category | Count | Coverage | Confidence |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Dining | 11 restaurants | Fayetteville + Oak Hill | High (8 verified, 3 partial) |
| Breweries | 2-3 venues | Fayetteville | Medium (1 confirmed, 1-2 need verification) |
| Hot Springs | 1 option | The Greenbrier (90 min) | Low (expensive, luxury-only option) |
| Hiking/Sightseeing | 8 trails/sites | NRG National Park | High (NPS-sourced) |
| Indoor | 6 venues | Fayetteville + Oak Hill + Beckley | Medium (most need hour verification) |
| Grocery | 3 stores | Fayetteville + Oak Hill | High (Walmart and Kroger verified) |

## Open Questions for Implementation
1. The Freefolk Brewery closure status must be resolved before including in the guide
2. "Fayetteville Brewing Co." from the spec may not exist — FR-004 can be satisfied with Bridge Brew Works + Southside Junction Tap House or Freefolk (if open)
3. Hot springs section will be thin — consider framing as "Spa & Soak" with honest assessment of limited options
4. February trail conditions are universally unverified — recommend a blanket disclaimer noting winter hiking conditions
