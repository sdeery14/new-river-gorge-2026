# Research: Problem Clusters

**Feature**: 002-problem-clusters
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Sources**: Training data (cutoff May 2025) — Mountain Project listings, "New River Rock" guidebook references (Mike Williams), NRAC community knowledge, 27crags, theCrag, and general NRG climbing community knowledge. **Web verification was denied; all problem data is [UNVERIFIED].**
**Data Confidence**: LOW-MODERATE — NRG bouldering is a developing scene. Named problems are sparse on Mountain Project. Many problems exist only in local guidebooks or word-of-mouth.

---

## Decision 1: Problem Curation Strategy

**Decision**: Include ALL known named problems rather than curating down. For well-documented areas (Summersville Lake), highlight classics. For sparsely documented areas (Gorge Boulders), the full list IS the curated list.

**Rationale**: NRG bouldering is not like Hueco Tanks or Bishop — there isn't a surplus of documented problems to filter. The challenge is finding enough documented problems, not trimming excess. Including all known problems maximizes trip utility while still organizing by grade band and highlighting classics.

**Classic designation criteria**: Mountain Project 3+ stars (where ratings exist), guidebook highlight/recommendation, or community consensus as a must-do problem.

---

## Decision 2: Shelter Status Inference

**Decision**: Infer shelter status from problem style and boulder geometry when direct shelter data isn't available.

**Rules applied**:
- Roof problems → Sheltered (the roof IS the shelter)
- Overhang problems on cliff-base boulders → Sheltered (cliff overhang above)
- Steep overhang on freestanding boulders → Partial (overhang sheds rain from face but no overhead roof)
- Vertical face / slab / arete → Exposed (unless boulder is under cliff overhang)
- Cave problems → Sheltered

**Risk**: This inference may be wrong for specific problems. All inferred shelter statuses are flagged [UNVERIFIED].

---

## Decision 3: Landing Quality Inference

**Decision**: Infer landing quality from area character and problem location.

**Rules applied**:
- Summersville Lake lakeshore boulders → Flat (exposed lakebed sandstone)
- Meadow River roadside boulders → Flat to Uneven (level ground near road)
- Gorge Boulders cliff-base → Uneven to Poor (talus, slope, roots)
- River boulders → Uneven (river rock, uneven bank)

**Risk**: Specific landings vary boulder-to-boulder. Flagged [UNVERIFIED].

---

## Decision 4: Source Priority

**Decision**: When sources disagree on grades, use Mountain Project consensus grade. When only one source exists, use that grade with range if disputed.

**Grade display**: V7 (V6-V8) format for disputed grades. Single grade for consensus grades.

---

## Named Problem Research: Meadow River

**Sources**: Mountain Project NRG bouldering listings, local guidebook references, community knowledge [ALL UNVERIFIED]
**Estimated total known named problems**: 15-20
**Research challenge**: Meadow River is the most developed dedicated bouldering area in the region, but online documentation (especially Mountain Project) is sparse. Many problems are documented only in local guidebooks or known by word-of-mouth. The problems below represent what can be identified from available sources.

## Named Problem Research: Summersville Lake

**Sources**: Mountain Project, "New River Rock" guidebook, USACE area info, community knowledge [ALL UNVERIFIED]
**Estimated total known named problems**: 30-40
**Research notes**: Best documented bouldering area in the NRG region. The Mike Williams guidebook includes Summersville Lake boulder problems. Winter drawdown exposes additional boulders not available in summer. Long Point sector is best documented.

**Summary**: 32 problems identified (6 V7-V10+, 13 V4-V6, 13 V0-V3). 7 classics. 3 partial shelter, 29 exposed. Flat landings dominate (lakebed sandstone).

**Key observation**: Summersville Lake is almost entirely exposed — very few sheltered problems. This matches the "Poor" rain resilience rating from Feature 001. The area's value is problem density and excellent flat landings, not rain protection.

## Named Problem Research: Gorge Boulders

**Sources**: Mountain Project, "New River Rock" guidebook, NPS climbing info, community knowledge [ALL UNVERIFIED]
**Estimated total known named problems**: 20-30
**Research notes**: Gorge bouldering is primarily cliff-base talus bouldering. Problems are scattered across 4 sectors. Endless Wall has the most documented bouldering. Many problems are unnamed eliminates at route bases — only named/established problems are included below.

### Kaymoor Sector

**NOTE**: Kaymoor is NOT RECOMMENDED for February primary use due to steel staircase approach hazard. Problems listed for reference only.

| 26 | Mine Slab | V1 | Slab | Exposed | Poor | Near old mine structures, low slab | | Guidebook [UNVERIFIED] |

**Summary**: 26 problems identified across 4 sectors.

| Sector | V0-V3 | V4-V6 | V7-V10+ | Total | Sheltered | Classics |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Endless Wall | 3 | 4 | 3 | 10 | 7 | 4 |
| Nuttall / Fern Buttress | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 1 |
| Bridge Buttress | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 1 |
| Kaymoor | 2 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 0 |
| **Total** | **8** | **10** | **8** | **26** | **17** | **6** |

**Key observation**: Gorge Boulders have the HIGHEST shelter ratio (17/26 = 65%) of any area. This is because most problems are cliff-base, under the overhanging gorge walls. Landings are predominantly Uneven or Poor (talus terrain). This makes the gorge the best rain-day bouldering destination by problem count.

**Notable**: Summersville Lake has ZERO sheltered classics. All its classics are on exposed lakeshore boulders. For rain-day bouldering, Summersville Lake is not an option.

## Critical Data Gaps

1. **Problem names**: Many of the names above may not match actual established names. NRG bouldering naming conventions are informal and inconsistent. Verify with local guidebooks at Water Stone Outdoors.
2. **Grade accuracy**: V-grades are from training data. Community consensus grades may differ by 1-2 grades in either direction.
3. **Mountain Project links**: Specific MP URLs for individual problems were not obtained (web access denied). Many of these problems may not have MP pages.
4. **Shelter verification**: Shelter status was inferred from problem style/location geometry, not from firsthand observation or explicit source data.
5. **Landing quality**: Inferred from area character. Specific boulder landings vary.
6. **Problem existence**: Some problems listed above may not exist as described. NRG bouldering is a developing scene and some references may be to problems that have been renamed, combined with other problems, or were never formally established.

## Verification Recommendations

Before finalizing problem cluster documents:
1. Visit Mountain Project and search each problem name
2. Cross-reference with "New River Rock" guidebook (available at Water Stone Outdoors)
3. Check 27crags.com and theCrag.com for additional NRG boulder listings
4. Call Water Stone Outdoors (304-574-2425) for current local beta on named problems
