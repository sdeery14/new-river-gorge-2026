# Quickstart: Using the Problem Cluster Documents

## File Structure

```

├── README.md                        ← Start here. Morning area selection. (Feature 001)
├── meadow-river.md                  ← Area profile (Feature 001)

```

## Morning Workflow (Extended from Feature 001)

1. Check the weather
2. Open `areas/README.md` → pick an area (Feature 001)
3. Open that area's `problems-{area}.md` → find your grade band
4. Scan for classics (⭐ marker) → those are today's objectives
5. Tap Mountain Project links for photos and beta

## Rain-Day Workflow

1. It's raining → open `areas/sheltered-classics.md`
2. Find your grade band under the area you're heading to
3. All listed problems are climbable during active rain
4. Shelter type tells you how protected you'll be (roof > overhang > partial)

## Week Planning (V10 Climbers)

1. Open `areas/hard-climbing.md`
2. Scan the full V7-V10+ table — sorted by grade, classics first
3. Note which areas/sectors have your target problems
4. Cross-reference shelter column for rain-day contingencies
5. Build your tick list for the week

## What Each Document Contains

### Per-Area Problem Clusters (problems-{area}.md)

- Quick-reference summary: curated count + classic count + sheltered count per grade band
- V7-V10+ problems listed FIRST (hard-climbing priority)
- Then V4-V6, then V0-V3
- Each problem: name, grade, style, shelter, landing, location, MP link, source

### Sheltered Classics (sheltered-classics.md)

- Sheltered quality problems from ALL areas in one document
- Organized by area, then by grade band
- Rain-day decision tool — 60-second scan to find climbable rock

### Hard Climbing (hard-climbing.md)

- ALL V7-V10+ problems from ALL areas in one table
- Sorted by grade (hardest first), classics highlighted
- Includes conditions notes for projecting (dry/cold, humidity-tolerant, etc.)

## Key Conventions

- **⭐**: Classic / must-do problem (MP 3+ stars, guidebook highlight, or community consensus)
- **Shelter**: Sheltered (stays dry in rain) / Partial (some protection) / Exposed (fully open)
- **Landing**: Flat (easy pad placement) / Uneven (careful placement) / Poor (dangerous)
- **Conditions** (V7-V10+ only): What weather/temps the problem needs
- **[UNVERIFIED]**: Not confirmed from a primary source — verify if critical
- **[MP]**: Tappable Mountain Project link for photos and community grades
