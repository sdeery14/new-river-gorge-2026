## 1. New River Gorge Geography & Wind

### 1.1 Gorge Geometry

| Parameter | Value | Source |

| Gorge orientation | Roughly north-south (river flows south to north) | [WVGES Geology](https://www.wvgs.wvnet.edu/www/geology/geoles01.htm) |
| Gorge width (rim to rim) | ~0.25-0.5 miles at the climbing areas near Fayetteville | [UNVERIFIED] |
| Rim elevation | ~2,000-2,200 ft | [NPS Weather](https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/weather.htm) |
| River elevation | ~800-1,000 ft at Fayette Station area | [UNVERIFIED] |

### 1.2 How Gorge Geometry Affects Wind

**Wind channeling (Venturi effect)**: Deep, narrow gorges act as wind channels. When ambient wind blows roughly parallel to the gorge axis (north or south), the constricted cross-section accelerates airflow through the gorge. Research on similar-scale river valleys (St. Lawrence River Valley, ~1,000 ft deep) demonstrates that winds within the valley align with the valley axis regardless of the ambient wind direction above — a phenomenon called **channeling**. Valley-floor wind speeds during channeling events can be 50-80% of the above-valley wind speed, though the direction is constrained to the valley axis. [Source: [AMS St. Lawrence Valley Wind Channeling Study](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/48/11/2009jamc2061.1.xml)]

**Wind sheltering**: When ambient wind blows perpendicular to the gorge (east-west at NRG), the gorge walls act as a barrier. The gorge floor is sheltered from cross-gorge winds. Wind speed on the gorge floor in cross-wind conditions can be 10-30% of rim wind speed. [UNVERIFIED — extrapolated from general valley meteorology, not measured at NRG]

**Thermal drafts (anabatic/katabatic winds)**:
- **Daytime (anabatic)**: Sun heats the gorge walls and floor, warming the air, which rises up the gorge walls. This creates gentle upslope breezes during sunny hours. Effect is mild at NRG due to heavy forest canopy absorbing heat before it reaches the air mass. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Nighttime/early morning (katabatic)**: Cool air drains downslope into the gorge, pooling on the gorge floor. The gorge floor is typically cooler than the rim by 3-8 degrees F in early morning, especially on calm, clear nights. This cold-air pooling also increases humidity on the gorge floor, slowing evaporation/drying. [UNVERIFIED — general Appalachian gorge behavior, not measured at NRG]

**Practical summary for climbers**: The gorge floor is consistently calmer and more humid than the rim. On windy days, the gorge provides wind shelter. On calm days, the gorge provides no drying advantage — it is actually worse (less airflow, more shade, higher humidity).

### 1.3 Rim Wind vs. Gorge Floor Wind

| Condition | Rim (plateau, ~2,000 ft) | Gorge Floor (~900 ft) |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Windy day (NW wind 15-25 mph) | Full exposure — gusty, uncomfortable in cold temps | Sheltered — 3-8 mph typical, channeled along gorge axis [UNVERIFIED] |
| Moderate wind (W wind 8-15 mph) | Noticeable, aids drying | Minimal — gorge walls block most cross-gorge wind [UNVERIFIED] |
| Calm day (< 5 mph ambient) | Calm | Dead calm — no drying wind advantage |
| Temperature difference | Reference temp | 3-8 F cooler in early morning (cold pooling); 2-5 F warmer midday in direct sun (rare on gorge floor) [UNVERIFIED] |
| Humidity | Reference humidity | 5-15% higher relative humidity (less evaporation, more moisture trapping) [UNVERIFIED] |

### 1.4 Wind Direction vs. Gorge Orientation

The gorge runs roughly **north-south**. Prevailing February winds in the Fayetteville/Beckley area are from the **west** (dominant direction for 11 months per Weather Spark data, peaking at 47% from west on January 1). [Source: [Weather Spark — Beckley WV](https://weatherspark.com/y/17999/Average-Weather-in-Beckley-West-Virginia-United-States-Year-Round)]

| Ambient Wind Direction | Effect on Gorge Floor | Effect on Rim/Plateau |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **West (prevailing)** | SHELTERED — wind hits gorge walls perpendicular to axis; gorge floor sees minimal wind | Full exposure |
| **Northwest** | Partially sheltered — some channeling component (NW has a north component aligned with gorge) | Full exposure |
| **North or South** | CHANNELED — wind funnels through gorge; gorge floor wind speed increases to 50-80% of ambient [UNVERIFIED] | Full exposure |
| **East** | SHELTERED — similar to westerly; perpendicular to gorge axis | Full exposure |

**Key insight for February**: Since prevailing winds are westerly (perpendicular to the gorge), the gorge floor is sheltered from wind on most February days. This is good for comfort (less wind chill) but bad for drying (less airflow to evaporate moisture). North/south wind events, while less common, can funnel through the gorge and produce gusty conditions on the gorge floor.

## 2. Per-Area Microclimate Comparison

### 2.1 Comparison Matrix

| Factor | Meadow River | Summersville Lake | Gorge Boulders |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Setting** | Road-cut boulders along US-60 in river corridor | Lakeshore boulders on exposed drawdown shoreline | Cliff-base boulders deep in NRG gorge |
| **Elevation** | ~1,800-2,000 ft [UNVERIFIED] | ~1,575 ft (winter pool) [UNVERIFIED] | ~900-1,100 ft (gorge floor) [UNVERIFIED] |
| **Wind exposure** | MODERATE | HIGH | LOW |
| **Sun exposure** | Mixed — depends on road/river orientation; some morning shade, afternoon sun [UNVERIFIED] | HIGH — open, treeless lakebed; good morning sun; south-facing rocks get all-day sun | LOW — gorge floor heavily shaded; north-facing walls get minimal winter sun; The Cirque (south-facing) is a notable exception |
| **Humidity** | Moderate — river proximity adds some moisture; wind offsets it | Low-Moderate — open air, wind reduces humidity | High — gorge floor traps moisture; limited airflow; cold-air pooling |
| **Drying speed** | FAST (for overhangs: already dry; vertical: 1-3 hrs with sun+wind) | MODERATE (no overhangs to stay dry; wind+sun aid drying but all surfaces get wet; 3-6+ hrs for vertical) | SLOW (overhangs: already dry under cliff base; vertical: 6-12+ hrs in shade with no wind) |
| **Shelter from rain** | GOOD — overhanging rock provides roof; roadside = some wind-driven rain on vertical faces | POOR — virtually no shelter; all surfaces exposed | EXCELLENT — cliff-base overhangs are natural roofs; Endless Wall/Nuttall sectors have the best shelter in the region |
| **Feb temp vs. Fayetteville** | Similar or slightly cooler (slightly higher elevation) [UNVERIFIED] | Similar (lower elevation offsets open exposure) [UNVERIFIED] | Cooler mornings (cold pooling); potentially warmer midday in rare direct sun |
| **Best condition** | Overcast + dry + wind (aids friction; overhangs climbable during rain) | Sunny + dry + calm-to-moderate wind (exposed lakebed = solar oven effect) | Calm + dry + any temp (shelter is the asset; wind irrelevant at cliff base) |
| **Worst condition** | Sustained heavy rain + no wind (vertical faces stay wet; seepage on cracks) | Active rain OR cold wind (all rock wet; wind chill makes it miserable) | Multi-day rain (seepage on cracks; vertical faces take 12-24+ hrs to dry in shade) |

### 2.2 Meadow River — Detailed Microclimate

**Setting**: Road-cut boulders and freestanding blocks along US-60 near Meadow Bridge, WV. The Meadow River corridor runs roughly east-west [UNVERIFIED], meaning the road/river valley is perpendicular to prevailing westerly winds — wind funnels along the valley from west to east, creating moderate but consistent airflow.

**Wind behavior**:
- River corridors channel wind similarly to gorges but with less dramatic effect (shallower valley, wider opening)
- Prevailing westerly wind aligns with the US-60 corridor orientation, producing consistent moderate wind at the boulders [UNVERIFIED — depends on exact local valley orientation]
- Wind speed at roadside boulders: estimated 60-80% of ambient wind speed (less sheltering than a deep gorge) [UNVERIFIED]
- Roadside position means no tree canopy to block wind on the road-facing side

**Sun pattern**:
- Valley orientation and hillside above the road create morning shade on some boulders [UNVERIFIED]
- Afternoon sun reaches most faces as the sun moves west
- Overhanging faces (the majority of hard climbing) are less affected by sun angle — shade from the overhang is the controlling factor
- South-facing road-cut faces get the most sun in February [UNVERIFIED]

**Drying analysis**:
- **Overhangs**: Already dry during and after rain. The steep, overhanging character of Meadow River rock means a significant portion of problems never get wet.
- **Vertical faces**: Dry in 1-3 hours with sun + wind. The combination of open roadside position (sun access) and river-corridor wind (airflow) makes this the fastest-drying area for non-sheltered rock.
- **Slabs**: Rare at Meadow River (rock is predominantly steep), but would dry in 2-4 hours with sun + wind.
- **Seepage**: Some on crack systems and horizontal breaks after heavy/prolonged rain. These dry from the outside in — surface dry first, seepage lines last. [UNVERIFIED]

**Shelter quality**: GOOD. The overhanging character of Meadow River boulders creates natural rain shelter. The V7+ problems are predominantly on overhanging faces and roofs, making this the best area for hard climbing during active rain. The roadside position means wind-driven rain can reach some vertical faces, but true overhangs are unaffected.

### 2.3 Summersville Lake — Detailed Microclimate

**Setting**: Lakeshore boulders on exposed shoreline revealed by the USACE winter drawdown (~77 ft below summer pool). Treeless, open lakebed with south-facing sandstone walls rising from the water's edge. The lake sits in a broad valley with minimal topographic wind shelter.

**Wind behavior**:
- HIGHEST wind exposure of the three areas — open lakeshore with no tree canopy, no gorge walls, no road cuts to block wind
- Lake surface creates a fetch (unobstructed distance over which wind travels), which accelerates wind near shore — similar to lake-effect wind patterns [UNVERIFIED]
- Winter wind gusts can reach 25-35 mph on exposed lakeshore during passage of cold fronts [UNVERIFIED]
- Wind aids drying but creates significant wind chill in February temps (38F ambient + 20 mph wind = feels like 24F) [UNVERIFIED — wind chill calculation is approximate]

**Sun pattern**:
- "The exposed white rock reflects sunlight, turning the lakebed into a solar oven" — [Water Stone Outdoors blog](https://www.waterstoneoutdoors.com/blog/nrg-winter-climbing-our-top-5-favorite-south-facing-crags)
- South-facing rocks get all-day sun in February; reports of climbers in t-shirts during January [Source: Water Stone Outdoors]
- Open exposure means first light to last light sun access — no gorge walls or canopy to block
- The treeless lakebed landscape maximizes solar gain: rock absorbs heat during the day, radiates it back, creating a warm microclimate on sunny days
- February sun angle (~30-35 degrees at solar noon, Fayetteville latitude 38 N) is low but sufficient for exposed south-facing rock [UNVERIFIED — sun angle is calculated, not measured]

**Drying analysis**:
- **Overhangs**: Few exist at Summersville Lake — the rock is predominantly vertical and slab. What few overhangs exist stay dry, but they are not a major feature of this area.
- **Vertical faces**: 3-6+ hours to dry after rain. Despite good sun and wind exposure, the lack of overhanging features means ALL surfaces get wet during rain. Wind and sun must evaporate moisture from every surface.
- **Slabs**: 4-8+ hours. Flat and low-angle surfaces hold water longer; pooled water on the flat lakebed can stay for extended periods.
- **Seepage**: Minimal (freestanding blocks don't have deep seepage systems), but surface water from pooling on the flat lakebed is the main moisture issue.
- **Cold wind paradox**: While wind aids evaporation, cold February wind can slow the drying process. Cold air holds less moisture (lower vapor pressure deficit), so evaporation rates are lower in cold, windy conditions than in warm, windy conditions. A sunny, calm 45F day may dry rock faster than a windy, overcast 35F day. [UNVERIFIED — general physics, not measured at site]

**Shelter quality**: POOR. Virtually no shelter from rain. The only marginal shelter is at the Orange Oswald Wall area, where cliff-base boulders have slight overhangs. For the vast majority of Summersville Lake bouldering, rain means retreat.

### 2.4 Gorge Boulders — Detailed Microclimate

**Setting**: Cliff-base talus boulders deep in the New River Gorge, 250-800 ft below the rim. Multiple sectors along the north and south gorge walls. The gorge runs north-south, is ~1,000 ft deep, and is heavily forested.

**Wind behavior**:
- LOWEST wind exposure of the three areas
- Gorge walls block most wind (prevailing westerly winds are perpendicular to the gorge)
- Cliff-base position is the most sheltered microsite within the gorge — the overhanging cliff above blocks descending air, and the talus field below does not generate thermal updrafts
- On rare north/south wind days, some channeled wind reaches the gorge floor, but cliff-base positions remain sheltered by the cliff geometry itself
- Bridge Buttress sector has HIGHER wind than other gorge sectors because it is closer to the gorge rim and the bridge opening creates a gap in the gorge wall [UNVERIFIED]

**Sun pattern**:
- Gorge floor is heavily shaded by gorge walls + forest canopy
- **North-facing walls** (e.g., much of Endless Wall cliff base) get virtually no direct winter sun. The south gorge wall blocks the low-angle February sun (sun rises in the SE, peaks at ~30-35 degrees elevation, sets in the SW — the south wall casts shadow over the north-side cliff base for most of the day in February) [UNVERIFIED — sun angle and shadow geometry are calculated estimates]
- **South-facing walls** (e.g., Kaymoor, parts of the south wall) get better sun exposure, but heavy tree canopy on the gorge walls filters most direct light
- **Notable exception**: The Cirque at Endless Wall is a south-facing amphitheater that "acts like a convection oven" in winter — south-facing, concave shape concentrates sunlight [Source: [Blue Ridge Outdoors](https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/bro-athletes-winter-climbing-in-the-new-river-gorge/)]
- Typical gorge-floor direct sun: 0-3 hours/day in February for north-facing cliff bases; 3-6 hours/day for south-facing sectors [UNVERIFIED]

**Drying analysis**:
- **Overhangs**: Stay dry under cliff-base overhangs. This is the gorge's primary weather-resilience advantage. The overhanging cliff bands at Endless Wall, Nuttall, and Kaymoor create natural roofs that keep cliff-base boulders dry during rain. Hard problems (V7+) are predominantly on overhanging cliff-base blocks — they are the most sheltered problems in the region.
- **Vertical faces**: SLOWEST drying of any area. 6-12 hours in overcast conditions, 12-24+ hours after heavy rain. The combination of deep shade (no sun to heat rock surface), low wind (gorge sheltering), and high humidity (cold-air pooling, moisture trapping) creates the worst drying conditions in the region for non-sheltered rock.
- **Seepage**: Seepage on crack systems and breaks is significant, especially in drainage areas (Fern Creek). Water migrates through the porous Nuttall sandstone from above; cliff-top drainage can produce seepage on overhanging faces hours or even days after rain stops. Seepage lines may never fully dry during multi-day wet periods. [UNVERIFIED — general Nuttall sandstone seepage behavior from climbing community knowledge]
- **Post-rain timeline**: Overhangs = immediate. Vertical in direct sun (rare) = 4-8 hrs. Vertical in shade = 8-24 hrs. Seepage lines = 24-72+ hrs.

**Shelter quality**: EXCELLENT — the best in the region. Cliff-base overhangs at Endless Wall, Nuttall, and Kaymoor provide natural roof coverage that keeps boulders dry during active rain. This is the only area where significant climbing is possible during sustained rain. Bridge Buttress has moderate shelter (less consistently overhanging cliff geometry).

## 3. Trail System Weather Behavior (Brief Cross-Reference)

These notes are for cross-reference with the bouldering area matrix. Full trail profiles are in `trails/`.

### 3.1 Arrowhead Trails (~5-10 min from Fayetteville)

| Factor | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Terrain | Appalachian plateau, rolling hills, ~1,900-2,100 ft elevation [UNVERIFIED] |
| Wind exposure | MODERATE-HIGH — plateau terrain with some tree cover; more exposed than gorge, less than lakeshore |
| Freeze/thaw | PRIMARY concern — dirt singletrack is extremely vulnerable. Frozen morning, soft midday on sunny days above 32F. Riding during thaw causes lasting trail damage. |
| Mud risk | HIGH — February peak mud season |
| Ice risk | MODERATE — shaded trail sections hold ice for days after freeze events |
| Snow | Common; accumulation may make trails impassable |
| Best riding | After 2-3 dry days with temps below freezing; early morning on frozen ground before midday thaw |
| Relevance to bouldering | A "biking morning" pairs well with an "afternoon bouldering session" when trails are frozen in AM but too soft after thaw — switch to climbing. |

*Full profile: [trails/arrowhead.md](../../trails/arrowhead.md)*

### 3.2 Summit Bechtel Reserve (~12-18 min from Fayetteville)

| Factor | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Terrain | Machine-built flow trails and XC singletrack, similar elevation to Arrowhead |
| Wind exposure | MODERATE — similar to Arrowhead but more exposed ridgeline trails |
| Freeze/thaw | Machine-built dirt trails are ESPECIALLY vulnerable — shaped berms and features degrade quickly with freeze/thaw cycling |
| Access | UNCERTAIN — private BSA facility, February access unconfirmed. Call (304) 465-2800 [UNVERIFIED] |
| Relevance to bouldering | Backup option only. If open and dry, a morning ride + afternoon bouldering session works well. |

*Full profile: [trails/summit-bechtel.md](../../trails/summit-bechtel.md)*

### 3.3 Babcock State Park (~30-35 min from Fayetteville)

| Factor | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Terrain | Old roads and railroad grades at ~2,000-2,500 ft elevation |
| Wind exposure | MODERATE — higher elevation means more exposure; tree cover provides some shelter |
| Freeze/thaw | Active — higher elevation = colder, more persistent frost/ice |
| Snow/ice | MORE likely than Fayetteville valley — higher elevation accumulates more snow, retains ice longer |
| Mud risk | HIGH — old roads and grades hold water |
| Hunting season | WV late seasons may extend into early-mid February — blaze orange strongly advisable |
| Relevance to bouldering | Sightseeing pairing (Glade Creek Grist Mill) more than a riding destination. On a non-climbing, non-riding day, Babcock + Fayetteville rest-day activities. |

## 4. Comparative Drying Speed Ranking

### 4.1 Overall Ranking (Fastest to Slowest)

| Rank | Area | Vertical Face Drying (post-rain, typical Feb conditions) | Why |
|------|------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| 1 (fastest) | **Meadow River** | 1-3 hrs (sun + wind) | Open roadside position + river-corridor wind + moderate sun exposure. Steep rock sheds water quickly. |
| 2 | **Summersville Lake** | 3-6+ hrs (sun + wind) | Excellent sun and wind, BUT all surfaces get wet (no overhangs to stay dry). Must evaporate everything. |
| 3 (slowest) | **Gorge Boulders** | 6-24+ hrs (shade + no wind) | Deep shade, no wind, high humidity on gorge floor. Vertical faces are the worst-case drying scenario. |

### 4.2 Overhang/Sheltered Rock Ranking

| Rank | Area | Overhang Status During/After Rain | Notes |
|------|------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| 1 (best shelter) | **Gorge Boulders** | Overhangs stay dry. Cliff-base roof coverage is unmatched. | Best for climbing DURING active rain. |
| 2 | **Meadow River** | Overhangs stay dry. Many hard problems on overhanging rock. | Good for climbing during rain. Less total shelter than gorge cliff base. |
| 3 (least shelter) | **Summersville Lake** | Very few overhangs. Almost everything gets wet. | Not climbable during rain. |

### 4.3 Drying Conditions by Weather Scenario

| Scenario | Meadow River | Summersville Lake | Gorge Boulders |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Light rain stops → sunny, breezy (40F) | Overhangs: immediate. Vertical: 1-2 hrs. | All wet. Vertical: 2-4 hrs. | Overhangs: immediate. Vertical: 4-8 hrs. |
| Heavy rain stops → overcast, calm (35F) | Overhangs: immediate. Vertical: 3-6 hrs. | All wet. Vertical: 6-12 hrs. Pooling on lakebed. | Overhangs: immediate. Vertical: 12-24 hrs. Seepage active. |
| Multi-day rain → clearing, sunny (42F) | Overhangs: immediate (check seepage). Vertical: 3-6 hrs. Seepage lines: 12-24 hrs. | All wet. Vertical: 6-12 hrs. Lakebed pools: 24+ hrs. | Overhangs: check seepage (may be active). Vertical: 24-48 hrs. Seepage: 48-72+ hrs. |
| Freezing after rain → 25F overnight | Overhangs: dry (were never wet). Vertical: frozen — DO NOT CLIMB wet frozen sandstone. | All frozen. DO NOT CLIMB. Wait for thaw + drying cycle. | Overhangs: may be dry. Vertical: frozen. Wait for thaw + extended drying. |

**All drying times are [UNVERIFIED] estimates.** February cold temperatures (avg high 42F, avg low 21F per [NPS Weather — Beckley reference](https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/weather.htm)) slow evaporation significantly compared to warmer seasons. These estimates assume February temperature ranges, not summer conditions.

## 5. Best and Worst Weather Scenarios by Area

### 5.1 Meadow River

| Scenario | Rating | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **BEST: Overcast, 35-45F, light breeze, dry** | IDEAL | Perfect friction (cool + dry). Overhangs climbable. Wind aids drying if any residual moisture. No sun glare. |
| **GOOD: Active rain, any temp** | GOOD | Overhanging problems stay dry. River corridor setting is functional in rain. Best active-rain bouldering in the region. |
| **GOOD: Post-rain, sunny, breezy, 40-50F** | GOOD | Overhangs: immediate. Vertical dries fast (1-3 hrs). Head to Meadow River first after a rain event. |
| **FAIR: Cold (25-35F), windy (15+ mph), dry** | FAIR | Friction is excellent on cold dry rock. BUT wind chill at roadside is uncomfortable. Dress for exposed position. |
| **WORST: Multi-day heavy rain + cold + no wind** | POOR | Seepage on crack systems. Vertical faces won't dry. Even overhangs may have active seepage on breaks. River may flood approach to river boulders. [UNVERIFIED] |

### 5.2 Summersville Lake

| Scenario | Rating | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **BEST: Sunny, calm-to-light wind, 40-55F, dry** | IDEAL | The "solar oven" effect. Exposed lakebed soaks up sun. Reports of climbers in t-shirts in January on sunny days. Best friction + best comfort. [Source: [Water Stone Outdoors](https://www.waterstoneoutdoors.com/blog/nrg-winter-climbing-our-top-5-favorite-south-facing-crags)] |
| **GOOD: Sunny, dry, cold (30-40F), calm** | GOOD | Still benefits from sun exposure. Cold = great friction. Layer up but enjoy the sun. |
| **FAIR: Post-rain (24+ hrs), sunny, breezy** | FAIR | Vertical faces may be dry after full day of sun+wind. Check specific faces before committing. Lakebed pools may persist. |
| **WORST: Active rain, any temp** | TERRIBLE | Virtually all problems exposed. No shelter. Go somewhere else immediately. |
| **WORST: Overcast, cold (< 35F), windy (15+ mph)** | TERRIBLE | No sun = no solar oven. Wind chill on exposed lakeshore is brutal. Exposed position provides no escape. |

### 5.3 Gorge Boulders

| Scenario | Rating | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **BEST: Active rain — Endless Wall / Nuttall sectors** | EXCELLENT | Cliff-base overhangs stay bone dry. The only place in the region for legit hard bouldering during rain. Gorge shelter = no wind chill. Approach may be slippery (microspikes). |
| **BEST: Cold (25-35F), dry, calm** | EXCELLENT | Gorge shelter eliminates wind chill. Cold = great friction. Overhang problems are dry. Ideal for projecting steep cliff-base problems. |
| **GOOD: Overcast, dry, any temp** | GOOD | Gorge floor is already shaded; overcast doesn't change much. Dry rock is climbable. |
| **FAIR: Post-rain (12+ hrs), overcast** | FAIR | Overhangs may be climbable. Vertical faces probably still wet. Seepage may be active. Check individual problems. |
| **WORST: Multi-day rain → overcast → no wind** | POOR for vertical faces | Vertical faces won't dry for 24-48+ hours. Seepage lines active. Even overhangs may seep on horizontal breaks. BUT overhang problems without seepage are still climbable. |
| **WORST: Post-rain → immediate freeze** | DANGEROUS | Icy gorge approaches. Frozen wet rock. Dangerous trail conditions (north-facing descents hold ice for days). Do not attempt gorge access on icy trails without microspikes. |

### 5.4 Quick Decision Matrix: "Where Do We Go Today?"

| Today's Conditions | Go Here | Avoid Here | Why |
|---------------------|---------|------------|-----|
| **Sunny, dry, calm, 40-55F** | Summersville Lake | — | Solar oven effect. Best conditions for the best beginner area. All faces dry and warm. |
| **Sunny, dry, cold (25-35F)** | Gorge Boulders OR Meadow River | Summersville Lake (wind chill if breezy) | Gorge shelter eliminates wind chill; Meadow River has dry overhangs. Summersville is OK if calm. |
| **Overcast, dry, 35-45F** | Meadow River | Summersville Lake | Meadow River has the best all-around conditions on overcast days. Summersville loses its primary advantage (sun). |
| **Active rain** | Gorge Boulders (Endless Wall/Nuttall) OR Meadow River | Summersville Lake | Gorge = cliff-base shelter. Meadow = overhang shelter. Summersville = no shelter at all. |
| **Post-rain (< 6 hrs), overcast** | Gorge Boulders (overhangs only) OR Meadow River (overhangs only) | Summersville Lake; avoid vertical faces anywhere | Only overhangs are dry. Gorge has the most overhang shelter; Meadow River overhangs are also dry. |
| **Post-rain (6-12 hrs), sunny + breezy** | Meadow River (vertical faces drying) | Gorge Boulders (vertical still wet) | Meadow River dries fastest. Add Summersville Lake if 8+ hours post-rain and sunny. |
| **Post-rain (24+ hrs), sunny** | All areas viable | — | Even gorge vertical faces are approaching dry. Summersville is fully recovered. Check seepage lines. |
| **Cold + windy (15+ mph), dry** | Gorge Boulders | Summersville Lake | Gorge = wind shelter. Summersville = exposed and miserable. Meadow River is tolerable but windy. |
| **Below freezing, ice on trails** | REST DAY or Fayetteville activities | Gorge Boulders (icy approaches) | Do not descend gorge trails when icy. Frozen wet sandstone = do not climb. |
| **Heavy snow** | REST DAY | All outdoor climbing | Enjoy Fayetteville. See `rest-day` options. |

## 6. February Wind Data Summary

### 6.1 Regional Wind Data (Beckley, WV — nearest full weather station)

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Feb avg wind speed | 6.4 mph (windiest month) | [Weather Spark — Beckley WV](https://weatherspark.com/y/17999/Average-Weather-in-Beckley-West-Virginia-United-States-Year-Round) |
| Prevailing direction | West (47% of time in January; dominant 11 months) | Weather Spark |
| Gust potential | Up to 25-35 mph during frontal passages | [NWS Charleston](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.79&lon=-81.19) [UNVERIFIED] |
| Calm periods (< 3 mph) | Common in early morning; increases with high-pressure stagnation | [UNVERIFIED] |

**Note**: Beckley (3,200 ft elevation) is ~20 miles south and ~1,000 ft higher than Fayetteville (~1,900 ft). Fayetteville's actual wind speeds are likely slightly lower than Beckley's due to lower elevation and gorge-adjacent terrain sheltering. [UNVERIFIED]

| Feb snowfall | 7.48 in avg (Fayetteville); 15.2 in normal (Beckley, higher elevation) | NPS Weather, NWS Beckley |
| Feb daylight hours | ~10.5-11 hrs (sunrise ~7:15 AM, sunset ~6:00 PM, Fayetteville latitude ~38 N) [UNVERIFIED — calculated, varies across the month] |
| Feb sun angle at noon | ~30-38 degrees above horizon (increasing through the month) [UNVERIFIED — calculated] |

**Why this matters for drying**: High humidity (84%), moderate-to-cool temperatures, and limited daylight mean February has the worst natural drying conditions of the year for this region. Cold air holds less moisture (lower vapor pressure), so evaporation is inherently slower. The combination of cold + humid + short days means drying time estimates should be treated as minimums — real-world drying may be 20-50% slower than summer equivalents.

## 7. Critical Data Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Verification Method |
|-----|--------|---------------------|
| Gorge-floor wind speed measurements | Current estimates are extrapolated from general valley meteorology; no NRG-specific anemometer data exists in public sources | Would require on-site measurement or NPS research data |
| Meadow River valley orientation | Assumed ~east-west based on US-60 route; actual river course may deviate | Verify via Google Maps satellite/terrain view |
| Exact sun angle calculations for gorge shadow | Estimated based on latitude and gorge depth; actual shadow depends on exact wall height, angle, and tree cover | Verify with SunCalc or similar tool + on-site observation |
| Summersville Lake wind data | No lakeshore-specific weather station; wind estimates based on general exposed-terrain behavior | Check USACE Summersville Lake for any monitoring data |
| Seepage timing on Nuttall sandstone | Drying estimates for seepage are community knowledge, not measured | Consult Water Stone Outdoors (304) 574-2425 or experienced NRG climbers |
| Fayetteville-specific wind data | Using Beckley station (~20 mi away, ~1,000 ft higher); Fayetteville has no full weather station | Check if NPS maintains weather monitoring at Canyon Rim Visitor Center |
