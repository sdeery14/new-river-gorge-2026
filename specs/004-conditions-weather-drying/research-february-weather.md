## 1. Temperature Ranges

### 1.1 Average February Temperatures — Fayetteville, WV (elev. ~1,900 ft)

Data synthesized from NOAA 1991-2020 Climate Normals reported via multiple verified sources. The nearest NOAA climate station with full records is **Beckley, WV (KBKW, elev. 2,504 ft)**; Fayetteville sits ~600 ft lower, so actual temperatures are typically **2-4°F warmer** than Beckley readings.

| Metric | Fayetteville (est.) | Beckley (NOAA) | Source |

| **Daily low range** (early → late Feb) | 26°F → 31°F | — | Same |

### 1.2 Extreme Temperatures

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **February rarely below** (low temp) | 10°F | [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/18036/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Fayetteville-West-Virginia-United-States) |
| **February rarely above** (high temp) | 65°F | Same |
| **Warmest February on record** (Beckley mean) | 47.0°F (1932) | [NWS Charleston](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/t10-bkw-feb) |
| **2nd warmest February** (Beckley mean) | 43.8°F (2018) | Same |
| **3rd warmest February** (Beckley mean) | 43.4°F (2023) | Same |
| **Coldest February on record** (Beckley mean) | 21.6°F (1978) | Same |
| **2nd coldest February** (Beckley mean) | 22.4°F (1947) | Same |
| **WV state record low (winter)** | -37°F (Lewisburg, Dec 30, 1917) | [NWS Charleston](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/wvext) |

**Note**: Lewisburg is ~50 miles east at higher elevation. Fayetteville rarely approaches these extremes, but single-digit lows (5-10°F) are plausible in February cold snaps.

### 1.3 Diurnal Temperature Cycle — Climbing Relevance

A typical February day in the NRG area follows this pattern:

| Time | Approx. Temp | Conditions | Climbing Impact |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **6:00 AM** | 22-28°F | Below freezing, frost/ice | Rock frozen, trails icy. Not climbing yet. |
| **8:00 AM** (~sunrise + 30 min) | 25-30°F | Sun hitting rim; gorge floor still shadowed | South-facing rim rock starts warming. Gorge floor remains frozen. |
| **10:00 AM** | 30-36°F | Crossing freezing threshold | **Danger zone**: ice melting, wet film on rock. Seepage begins on crack systems. |
| **12:00 PM** | 36-42°F | Above freezing, peak solar angle | Best friction window if dry. Sun reaches deeper into gorge. |
| **2:00 PM** | 40-45°F | Daily high (often warmest) | Good conditions if dry. Some seepage possible on horizontal breaks. |
| **4:00 PM** | 36-42°F | Cooling begins, shadows lengthen | Still climbable. Friction improving as temps drop. |
| **5:30 PM** | 30-35°F | Near sunset, rapid cooling | End of climbing day. Approaching refreeze. |
| **7:00 PM** | 26-30°F | Below freezing again | Rock refreezing. Trail ice reforming. |

**Key climbing insight**: The "golden window" for February bouldering is roughly **11:00 AM to 4:00 PM** — after the morning thaw transition completes (rock is dry, not dripping) and before afternoon cooling makes conditions uncomfortable. On sunny days, south-facing rock can be 10-15°F warmer than air temperature due to solar heating. [UNVERIFIED — solar gain estimate is general; depends on rock color, angle, and wind]

### 1.4 Freeze/Thaw Cycle Details

February is the peak freeze/thaw month at this elevation:

- **Overnight freeze (6 PM - 9 AM)**: ~15 hours below freezing on a typical night
- **Daytime thaw (9 AM - 6 PM)**: ~9 hours above or near freezing
- **Transition periods**: The 30-45 minutes around the freezing-point crossing (morning and evening) are the most dangerous for climbing — a thin film of meltwater on the rock surface creates deceptively slick conditions with zero friction warning
- **Frozen rock friction**: Paradoxically, fully frozen dry rock can provide excellent friction. The issue is the _transition_ — partially frozen/partially thawed rock is unpredictable
- **Number of freeze/thaw days**: Beckley averages an estimated **18-22 days** in February where the temperature crosses 32°F at least once [UNVERIFIED — estimated from mean temps bracketing 32°F]

## 2. Precipitation

### 2.1 February Precipitation Summary

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Average total precipitation** | 2.9-3.1 inches | [CurrentResults (Beckley: 3.1")](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/West-Virginia/precipitation-february.php), [NWS Charleston (Beckley normal: 3.12")](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/t10-bkw-feb) |
| **Precipitation days** (>=0.01") | 12-15 days | [CurrentResults (Beckley: 14)](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/West-Virginia/precipitation-february.php), [USClimateData (Beckley: 12)](https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/beckley/west-virginia/united-states/uswv0049) |
| **Average snowfall** | 4-10 inches (elevation-dependent) | Weather Spark (Fayetteville: 4.1"), [USClimateData (Beckley: 10")](https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/beckley/west-virginia/united-states/uswv0049), [NWS (Beckley normal: 15.2")](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/t10-bkw-feb) |
| **Wettest February on record** (Beckley) | 7.53" (2025) | [NWS Charleston](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/t10-bkw-feb) |
| **Driest February on record** (Beckley) | 0.32" (1901) | Same |
| **Greatest Feb snowfall on record** (Beckley) | 49.8" (2010) | Same |
| **Least Feb snowfall on record** (Beckley) | 0.0" (1949) | Same |

**Snowfall elevation note**: Beckley (2,504 ft) gets substantially more snow than Fayetteville (1,900 ft). The 15.2" Beckley normal likely translates to **6-10 inches** at Fayetteville elevation. The gorge floor (800-1,000 ft) sees even less snow accumulation. [UNVERIFIED — snowfall elevation adjustment is estimated]

### 2.2 Precipitation Type Breakdown

From [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/18036/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Fayetteville-West-Virginia-United-States) analysis of Fayetteville February precipitation days:

| Type | Probability on a Given Day | Trend Through Month |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Rain only** | 18-25% | Increases through February |
| **Snow and rain mix** | ~5% | Roughly constant |
| **Snow only** | ~3% | Roughly constant |
| **Any precipitation** | 27-32% | Increases slightly through month |
| **Dry day** | 68-73% | Decreases slightly through month |

**Interpretation for climbers**: On any given February day, there is roughly a **70% chance of no precipitation** and a **30% chance of some precipitation**. Rain is 3-4x more likely than snow-only events. Mixed precipitation (sleet, freezing rain, rain/snow mix) is common and the most disruptive for climbing — it wets the rock without cold-enough temps to keep it frozen.

### 2.3 Multi-Day Rain Events

Based on Appalachian weather patterns at this latitude and time of year:

- **2-3 day rain events**: Occur approximately **2-3 times per February** when low-pressure systems track through the Ohio Valley or up the East Coast [UNVERIFIED]
- **4+ day continuous rain**: Less common (perhaps **once every 2-3 Februaries**) but possible with stalled fronts [UNVERIFIED]
- **Typical rain event duration**: 1-2 days, with the heaviest precipitation in a 6-12 hour window [UNVERIFIED]
- **"Week-long rain storms"**: Mountain Project notes for NRG state "it is not uncommon to get hosed with week-long rain storms" though this is more typical of spring/fall than February ([Mountain Project NRG overview](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105855991/the-new-river-gorge-region))

### 2.4 Post-Rain Drying Recovery

Drying times for Nuttall sandstone after rain, incorporating February-specific conditions. Nuttall sandstone is 98% quartz — significantly harder and less porous than western sandstones, meaning it loses less strength when wet but still takes time to dry.

**Community standard**: NRAC and the NRG climbing community strongly discourage climbing on wet Nuttall sandstone. Minimum **24 hours** after rain before climbing; **36 hours** is safer. The stone is more friable when saturated — this is a rock-preservation concern, not just a friction issue. ([Access Fund guidance](https://www.accessfund.org/latest-news/open-gate-blog/how-to-assess-sandstone-after-rain-or-snow), [KAYA Climb NRG bouldering guide](https://blog.kayaclimb.com/new-river-gorge-bouldering-how-when-where/))

| Drying Scenario | Estimated Time to Climbable | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Light rain -> sunny + windy** | Overhangs: already dry. Vertical: 2-4 hrs. Slab: 4-8 hrs. | Best case. Wind + sun = fastest drying. |
| **Light rain -> overcast, calm** | Vertical: 6-12 hrs. Slab: 12-24 hrs. | February cold slows evaporation significantly. |
| **Heavy rain (6+ hrs) -> sunny + windy** | Overhangs: dry (check seepage). Vertical: 6-12 hrs. Slab: 12-24 hrs. | Seepage on horizontal breaks may persist 24+ hrs. |
| **Heavy rain -> overcast + cold (<35F)** | Vertical: 24-48 hrs. Slab: 48+ hrs. | Worst case. Cold + humid + no sun = almost no evaporation. |
| **Multi-day soaking -> any conditions** | All angles: 24-48+ hrs minimum | Seepage will persist for days on crack systems. |

**Drying condition factors**:

| Factor | Speeds Drying | Slows Drying |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Sun | Direct sunlight on rock face | Shaded, north-facing |
| Wind | Sustained breeze (5+ mph) | Calm, sheltered |
| Temperature | Above 45°F | Below 35°F |
| Humidity | Below 50% | Above 80% (February avg: 84%) |
| Wall angle | Overhanging (water runs off) | Slab (water pools) |

**February-specific challenge**: February is the most humid month in Fayetteville (avg. 84% relative humidity per [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/y/18036/Average-Weather-in-Fayetteville-West-Virginia-United-States-Year-Round)). Combined with cold temps, this means evaporative drying is at its annual minimum. **Plan for longer drying times than you would expect in fall or spring.**

All drying times are [UNVERIFIED] estimates based on community knowledge and Access Fund general guidance adapted for February conditions.

## 3. Wind

### 3.1 February Wind Summary

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Average wind speed** | 6.3-7.4 mph | [Weather Spark (6.3 mph)](https://weatherspark.com/y/18036/Average-Weather-in-Fayetteville-West-Virginia-United-States-Year-Round), [Weather-Atlas (7.4 mph)](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/west-virginia-usa/fayetteville-climate) |
| **Prevailing direction** | West / West-Southwest | [Weather Spark: 46% westerly on Feb 2](https://weatherspark.com/m/18036/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Fayetteville-West-Virginia-United-States) |
| **February rank** | Windiest or near-windiest month of the year | Same sources |
| **Peak gusts (storm events)** | 30-60+ mph possible in winter storms | [NWS Charleston winter forecasts](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/winter) note 45-60 mph ridge gusts |

### 3.2 How the New River Gorge Affects Wind

The New River Gorge is oriented roughly **NE-SW** (the river flows northward through the gorge). Gorge depth is ~1,000 ft. Prevailing February winds are westerly. See `research.md` section 1 for detailed gorge wind dynamics. Summary:

| Location | Wind Behavior | Climbing Impact |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Gorge rim / bridge level** | Full exposure to prevailing W/WSW winds. Accelerated over exposed points. | Exposed, uncomfortable in cold. Not where we climb. |
| **Gorge floor / cliff base** | **Sheltered**. Gorge walls block westerly cross-gorge wind. Calm to light breeze typical. | Comfortable for climbing even on windy days. Less wind = slower drying after rain. |
| **Gorge funneling** | N or S winds funnel through gorge axis. Less common than cross-gorge (W) winds. | Occasional strong drafts at gorge floor during certain pressure patterns. [UNVERIFIED] |
| **South-facing walls** | Protected from prevailing W wind. Receive direct sun. | Best winter climbing: warm from sun, sheltered from wind. |
| **Summersville Lake** | Fully exposed, no gorge shelter. Open lakeshore catches full wind. | Windy + cold = miserable. But wind aids drying significantly. |
| **Meadow River** | Moderate. River corridor funnels some wind, but forest canopy and valley walls provide partial shelter. | Middle ground between gorge (sheltered) and lake (exposed). |

[UNVERIFIED — Gorge wind dynamics are inferred from topography, gorge orientation, and general Appalachian mountain meteorology. No NRG-specific wind study was found. See `research.md` section 1 for detailed analysis and sources.]

### 3.3 Wind Chill Impact on Climbing Comfort

Using the NWS Wind Chill formula: `Wind Chill (F) = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75(V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16)` ([source](https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold-wind-chill-chart))

Wind chill values for typical February climbing conditions:

| Air Temp | Calm | 5 mph | 10 mph | 15 mph | 20 mph |
|----------|------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **40°F** | 40°F | 36°F | 34°F | 32°F | 30°F |
| **35°F** | 35°F | 31°F | 27°F | 25°F | 24°F |
| **30°F** | 30°F | 25°F | 21°F | 19°F | 17°F |
| **25°F** | 25°F | 19°F | 15°F | 13°F | 11°F |
| **20°F** | 20°F | 13°F | 9°F | 6°F | 4°F |

**Climbing comfort zones**:
- **Above 30°F feels-like**: Manageable with layers. Fingers functional after warm-up. Core climbing fully possible.
- **20-30°F feels-like**: Requires hand warmers in chalk bag, warm belay jacket, multiple warm-up problems. Core climbing possible but finger dexterity drops noticeably.
- **Below 20°F feels-like**: Marginal. Thin gloves needed between attempts. Finger skin cracks and splits. Many climbers would choose a rest day or bike ride.
- **At gorge floor** (sheltered from wind): Feels-like temp is approximately equal to actual air temp. This is a major advantage of gorge climbing in winter.
- **At Summersville Lake** (exposed): Feels-like temp can be 10-15°F lower than air temp on windy days.

## 4. Daylight

### 4.1 February 2026 Sunrise / Sunset — Fayetteville, WV (~38.05°N, 81.10°W)

| Date | Sunrise | Sunset | Day Length | Climbing Window* |
|------|---------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Feb 1** | 7:28 AM | 5:47 PM | 10h 19m | ~9:00 AM - 5:15 PM |
| **Feb 7** | 7:22 AM | 5:54 PM | 10h 32m | ~8:50 AM - 5:20 PM |
| **Feb 14** | 7:15 AM | 6:02 PM | 10h 47m | ~8:45 AM - 5:30 PM |
| **Feb 15** | 7:14 AM | 6:03 PM | 10h 49m | ~8:45 AM - 5:30 PM |
| **Feb 21** | 7:06 AM | 6:09 PM | 11h 03m | ~8:30 AM - 5:40 PM |
| **Feb 28** | 6:57 AM | 6:16 PM | 11h 19m | ~8:30 AM - 5:45 PM |

Source: [TimeAndDate.com — Fayetteville, WV](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/@4805686?month=2&year=2026)

*Climbing window = approximate usable light for bouldering, accounting for ~30 min after sunrise for adequate light and warmth, and ~30 min before sunset for dimming/shadow.

### 4.2 Gorge Shadow Effect

The New River Gorge is 800-1,000 ft deep. In February, the low sun angle means:

- **Gorge floor**: Direct sun arrives **1-2 hours after official sunrise** and leaves **1-2 hours before official sunset**, depending on wall orientation and gorge section. Effective sunlight on the gorge floor may be as short as **6-7 hours** in mid-February. [UNVERIFIED — estimate based on gorge depth and February sun angle at 38°N]
- **South-facing walls**: Get the most and earliest sun — these are the premier winter climbing walls. The Cirque at Endless Wall and Whippoorwill/Long Point are noted sun traps. ([Water Stone Outdoors](https://www.waterstoneoutdoors.com/blog/nrg-winter-climbing-our-top-5-favorite-south-facing-crags))
- **North-facing walls**: May receive **zero direct sun** in the deepest parts of the gorge in February
- **Summersville Lake**: No gorge shadow. Full sunrise-to-sunset sun exposure on open lakeshore boulders.
- **Meadow River**: Moderate valley, less deep than the gorge. Gets more direct sun than gorge floor.

### 4.3 Practical Daylight Strategy (Feb 14-21 Trip)

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **6:45-7:15 AM** | Sunrise. Eat breakfast, check forecast, pack gear. |
| **8:30-9:00 AM** | Leave lodging. Drive to area (5-40 min depending on destination). |
| **9:00-10:00 AM** | Arrive, approach trail, warm up. Gorge floor still shadowed and possibly icy. |
| **10:00 AM - 12:00 PM** | Morning session. Sun reaching deeper into gorge. Temps crossing 32°F — watch for thaw seepage. |
| **12:00 - 1:00 PM** | Lunch break. Peak solar heating. |
| **1:00 - 4:00 PM** | Afternoon session. Warmest temps, best conditions if dry. |
| **4:00 - 5:30 PM** | Last attempts. Shadows returning. Temps dropping. |
| **5:30 - 6:00 PM** | Pack up, hike out before dark. **Headlamp recommended for gorge trails.** |

**Total usable climbing time**: Approximately **5-7 hours** depending on approach length and conditions. Plan for the shorter end on gorge-floor days (shadow effect), the longer end at Summersville Lake or Meadow River.

## 5. Weather Patterns That Matter for Climbing

### 5.1 Decision Matrix — Weather Scenario to Climbing Action

| Scenario | Conditions | Action | Best Area | Worst Area |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Clear + Cold + Dry** | Sunny, <35°F, no recent rain | CLIMB. Best friction. South-facing walls. | Gorge (sheltered, south-facing), Summersville (if calm) | North-facing gorge (icy, shadowed) |
| **Clear + Warm + Dry** | Sunny, >45°F, no recent rain | CLIMB. Excellent day. All options open. | Any area | None |
| **Overcast + Warm + Dry** | Cloudy, 40-50°F, no recent rain | CLIMB. Good temps, check for seepage on cracks. | Meadow River (steep = less seepage) | Gorge cracks (seepage risk) |
| **Overcast + Cold + Dry** | Cloudy, <35°F, no recent rain | CLIMB with layers. Marginal but climbable. | Gorge floor (wind-sheltered) | Summersville Lake (wind + cold) |
| **Active Rain** | Any temperature, raining | SHELTERED OVERHANGS ONLY or skip. Consider biking or rest. | Gorge cliff-base overhangs, Meadow River overhangs | Summersville Lake (no shelter) |
| **Post-Rain: Sunny + Windy** | Sun, breeze, 6-24 hrs after rain | WAIT then climb. Fastest drying. Overhangs first. | Summersville (wind dries), Meadow River overhangs | Deep gorge floor (no wind, slow drying) |
| **Post-Rain: Overcast + Cold** | Cloudy, <35°F, 6-24 hrs after rain | WAIT LONGER. Slowest drying. Rest day or bike. | Meadow River overhangs (already dry) | Any slab or vertical rock |
| **Post-Rain: 24-48 hrs out** | Cloudy, <35°F, 1-2 days after rain | CHECK individual walls. Overhangs dry. Verticals: touch-test. | Gorge overhangs (dry under shelter) | Summersville slabs (still damp) |
| **Freeze/Thaw: Early AM** | <28°F, frozen overnight, clear sky | APPROACH with microspikes. Frozen dry rock = good friction. | South-facing walls (first to warm) | Trail approaches (icy) |
| **Freeze/Thaw: Midday** | 30-34°F, thawing | DANGER. Wet film on rock. Wait for full thaw + dry. | None — worst moment of the day | Slab and low-angle rock |
| **Snow on Ground** | Accumulation, any temp | Approach is the issue. Brush snow off boulders. Check for ice underneath. | Short-approach areas (Bridge Buttress, roadside Meadow River) | Kaymoor (long icy descent) |

### 5.2 Best-Case and Worst-Case Days

**Best-case climbing day**:
- Previous day: dry (or 24+ hrs since rain)
- Overnight: clear skies, below freezing (24-28°F)
- Morning: sunny, warming through 32°F by 9-10 AM
- Afternoon: sunny, high of 42-50°F, light breeze (3-8 mph)
- Produces: cold dry rock with excellent friction, comfortable climbing temps, dry conditions all day

**Worst-case climbing day**:
- Overnight: rain/sleet turning to freezing rain
- Morning: overcast, 33°F, drizzle, fog
- Afternoon: continued overcast, 36°F, intermittent rain
- Produces: wet rock, seeping cracks, icy approaches, zero climbable rock. Rest day.

## 6. Seven-Day Window Analysis (Feb 14-21)

### 6.1 Probability of Dry Climbing Days in a 7-Day February Window

Using the daily precipitation probability of ~30% (from Weather Spark data), and factoring in that precipitation events are often multi-day (not independent):

| Dry Climbing Days | Estimated Probability | Interpretation |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **0 days** (rained every day) | ~3-5% | Very unlikely but possible with a stalled system |
| **1-2 days** | ~15-20% | Unlucky but not unusual — extended rain event + slow drying |
| **3-4 days** | ~35-40% | **Most likely outcome.** Typical February week. |
| **5-6 days** | ~25-30% | Good luck. Dry spell or quick-clearing systems. |
| **7 days** (fully dry) | ~5-10% | Rare. Would require an extended high-pressure ridge. |

[UNVERIFIED — These probabilities are estimated from climate normals and general Appalachian weather pattern knowledge. No station-specific daily probability analysis was performed. Multi-day correlation between precipitation events makes the naive independent-days calculation inaccurate.]

**Expected value**: In a 7-day February window, plan for **3-5 climbable days** and **2-4 days** that are either active rain, post-rain drying, or marginal conditions.

**Important nuance**: "Climbable day" does not mean "fully dry everywhere." On a post-rain day with sun, overhanging problems at Gorge Boulders or Meadow River may be climbable while vertical faces are still wet. The decision matrix in section 5.1 maps partial conditions to partial climbing opportunities.

### 6.2 February Warm Spell Probability

"Warm spell" defined as 3+ consecutive days with highs above 45°F:

- **Frequency**: Approximately **1-2 warm spells per February** based on the daily high range increasing from 41°F (Feb 1) to 49°F (Feb 28) [UNVERIFIED]
- **Timing**: More likely in the second half of February as average highs increase. The Feb 14-21 window sits right in the transition — average daily high crosses from ~44°F to ~47°F during this period.
- **Duration**: Typical warm spells last **3-5 days** before the next cold front arrives [UNVERIFIED]
- **Probability of encountering a warm spell during Feb 14-21**: Roughly **40-60%**. Average highs are already approaching 45°F by mid-February. [UNVERIFIED]
- **Historical reference**: The warmest February on record at Beckley (47.0°F mean, 1932) shows the entire month can average above 45°F, though this is extreme. More recently, February 2018 (43.8°F mean) and February 2023 (43.4°F mean) were notably warm. ([NWS Charleston](https://www.weather.gov/rlx/t10-bkw-feb))

### 6.3 Late February Advantage

The Feb 14-21 window benefits from several late-February trends:
- **Increasing daylight**: 10h 47m (Feb 14) -> 11h 03m (Feb 21) — gaining ~2+ minutes per day
- **Warming trend**: Average highs climb ~1°F per 3 days through late February
- **Snow frequency decreasing**: Snow-only events become less common through the month
- **Rain frequency increasing**: More rain (not snow) means fewer days completely locked out by snow coverage, but more wet-rock waiting periods

### 7.4 Recommended Daily Weather Check Routine

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Night before** | Check NWS 7-day forecast. Note overnight low (freeze risk), next-day high, precipitation probability. Make preliminary plan. |
| **Morning (7 AM)** | Check hourly forecast for today. Check radar for incoming precipitation. Finalize area selection. |
| **Before leaving lodging** | Quick radar check — any surprise systems? |
| **At the crag** | If conditions change (unexpected drizzle, wind shift), check radar on phone. Have a backup plan. |
| **Evening** | Check 3-day outlook. Adjust multi-day planning (e.g., "rest day tomorrow if rain persists, climb day after"). |

## 10. Data Gaps and Verification Needed

1. **Fayetteville-specific NOAA normals**: No NOAA climate station exists in Fayetteville proper. All official NOAA data uses Beckley (KBKW) as the nearest full-service station. The 600 ft elevation difference means Fayetteville is 2-4°F warmer and gets less snow. Fayetteville-specific numbers throughout this document are derived from Beckley normals with elevation adjustments. [UNVERIFIED adjustment methodology]

2. **Drying times in February cold**: Published drying guidance (Access Fund, climbing community) assumes temperatures above 50°F. February temperatures (30-45°F) with 84% humidity create a substantially different drying environment. The extended drying times in this document are estimates adapted from warmer-season data. [UNVERIFIED]

3. **7-day dry day probability**: No station-specific analysis of consecutive dry-day probability was available. The estimates use daily precipitation probability combined with general understanding of multi-day weather system correlation. A proper analysis would require daily precipitation records from Beckley's full historical dataset.

4. **Warm spell frequency**: No statistical analysis of warm-spell frequency was found for this specific station and month. The estimate is derived from the mean daily high temperature trend and general synoptic pattern knowledge. [UNVERIFIED]

5. **Gorge shadow timing**: The claim that the gorge floor loses 1-2 hours of sun at each end of the day is estimated from gorge depth (~1,000 ft) and February solar elevation angle (~30-35° at noon for 38°N). Actual shadow patterns vary by gorge section, wall orientation, and forest canopy. [UNVERIFIED]

6. **Record temperatures for Fayette County**: County-specific monthly records are not readily available online. Beckley records (NWS Climate Top 10) serve as the best available proxy.

7. **February precipitation event correlation**: The probability estimates in section 6.1 assume some multi-day correlation between precipitation events but do not use a rigorous statistical model. These are informed estimates, not calculations from raw data.
