## Section 1: Access Point Inventory (Consolidated from Features 001 & 003)

### Bouldering Areas

#### Meadow River
- **Drive**: ~30 min from Fayetteville via US-60 E
- **Parking**: Gravel pulloffs along US-60 E, ~5-10 vehicle capacity per pulloff [UNVERIFIED]
- **GPS**: 38.0210, -80.8590 [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: 50-200 yards (roadside) to 0.25 miles (river boulders), 2-10 min walk, flat
- **Land manager**: Private / County road ROW [UNVERIFIED]
- **Regulations**: No fees, crash pads and chalk permitted, no seasonal closures [UNVERIFIED]
- **Winter access**: US-60 is state highway, plowed year-round. Pulloffs may accumulate snow [UNVERIFIED]
- **February hazards**: Minimal — short flat approaches. River crossing may be needed for some boulders
- **Alternate access**: None needed — US-60 is the only route and is reliably maintained

#### Summersville Lake
- **Drive**: ~35 min from Fayetteville via US-19 N → WV Rt. 129
- **Parking**: Long Point Trailhead — small gravel lot, ~10-15 vehicles, off WV Rt. 129 [UNVERIFIED]
- **GPS**: 38.1350, -80.8920 [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: ~0.5-1.0 mi from Long Point trailhead, ~150-250 ft descent, 15-25 min
- **Land manager**: USACE (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) — NOT NPS
- **Regulations**: No fees, crash pads and chalk permitted, no seasonal closures, but access roads may be gated Nov-Apr [UNVERIFIED]
- **Winter access**: Some USACE access roads gated Nov-Apr. Long Point is most reliable year-round. Call USACE (304) 872-3459 to confirm gate status [UNVERIFIED]
- **February hazards**: Trail can be muddy/icy. Exposed lakebed slippery when wet/icy. Microspikes helpful
- **Alternate access**: Long Point Trailhead is the primary year-round access; if gated, no good alternate exists — choose different area

#### Gorge Boulders — Endless Wall / Fern Creek
- **Drive**: ~10 min from Fayetteville via Lansing-Edmond Rd / CR 82
- **Parking**: NPS paved lot, Endless Wall Trailhead, ~15-20 vehicles [UNVERIFIED]
- **GPS**: 38.0670 N, -81.0785 W [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: 0.7-1.0 mi, 250-350 ft descent, 20-35 min
- **February hazards**: North-facing descent = icy. Wooden boardwalks icy when frozen. Microspikes essential. Mud at cliff base
- **Alternate access**: If Endless Wall parking full, use Long Point Trailhead (~0.5 mi east)

#### Gorge Boulders — Bridge Buttress (Shortest Approach)
- **Drive**: ~5-15 min from Fayetteville
- **Parking**: Fayette Station area OR Canyon Rim Visitor Center (larger, safer in winter) [UNVERIFIED]
- **GPS**: 38.0705 N, -81.0830 W (Fayette Station) OR 38.0700 N, -81.0750 W (Canyon Rim) [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: Shortest in gorge — 0.2-0.4 mi, 100-200 ft descent, 5-15 min
- **February hazards**: Fayette Station Road may be closed in icy conditions [UNVERIFIED]
- **Alternate access**: If Fayette Station Road closed, approach from Canyon Rim Visitor Center (longer, ~0.5-0.7 mi)

- **Drive**: ~10 min from Fayetteville (cross bridge, Kaymoor Road)
- **Parking**: NPS lot, ~8-12 vehicles [UNVERIFIED]
- **GPS**: 38.0580 N, -81.0690 W [UNVERIFIED]
- **Approach**: 30-50 min, 600-800 ft descent via 800+ steel grate steps
- **February hazards**: Steel grate steps extremely slippery when wet/icy. Microspikes provide poor traction on steel grate. Strenuous return ascent. **DO NOT USE unless conditions dry/above freezing for several consecutive days.**
- **Alternate access**: No alternate — if Kaymoor steps are icy, choose a different area entirely

#### Gorge Boulders — General Regulations (NPS)

## Section 2: Airport Research

### Airport Comparison

| Airport | Code | Drive Time | Airlines | Rental Cars | Recommendation |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Yeager (Charleston, WV) | CRW | ~1 hr 25 min | American, Breeze, Delta, United | Yes (6 agencies) | **Primary — best option** |
| Greenbrier Valley (Lewisburg, WV) | LWB | ~1 hr 15 min | SkyWest (American), Contour | Yes (4 agencies) | Secondary — limited flights |
| Raleigh County (Beckley, WV) | BKW | ~40 min | Contour only (CLT route) | Yes (3 agencies) | Closest but single airline/route |
| Roanoke-Blacksburg (VA) | ROA | ~2 hr 35 min | Allegiant, American, Delta, United | Yes | Backup — best airline diversity but long drive |

### Decision: CRW (Charleston) Recommended for Wednesday Arrival

- **Rationale**: Most flights, most rental car options, manageable ~1.5 hr drive via US-19 S / I-77
- **Alternatives considered**: LWB is closer but has very limited flight schedules (CLT and ORD connections only). BKW is closest (40 min) but only serves Charlotte via Contour — too limited for flexible scheduling
- **Arriving member options**: (1) Rent a car at CRW and drive to Fayetteville — adds to fleet for rest of week; (2) Be picked up by group member — costs group ~3 hrs round trip

## Section 3: Winter Road Conditions

### Highway Plowing Priority

| Road | Priority | Winter Status |
|------|----------|---------------|
| US-19 (main corridor) | Priority 1 | Plowed first; pre-treated with brine. Reliable year-round |
| I-64, I-77 (interstates) | Priority 1 | Plowed first. Airport route to Fayetteville |
| Fayette Station Road | Low | NPS-managed; may close in ice/snow. Narrow, steep, winding |
| Gorge access roads | Low | Secondary priority; expect delays after storms |
| US-60 (to Meadow River) | Priority 1-2 | State highway, generally maintained |
| WV-41 (to Babcock) | Priority 2-3 | State road but lower priority than US-19/60 |

- **Road condition hotline**: Call 511 or visit wv511.org

### Fayette Station Road Warning

Fayette Station Road is the direct route to Bridge Buttress and lower gorge access points. It descends ~700 ft from the rim to the gorge floor via a narrow, winding road with no guardrails in places. In icy conditions:
- NPS may close the road entirely
- Even when open, the road surface can be treacherous (black ice in shaded sections)
- **Alternate**: Use Canyon Rim Visitor Center parking and approach on foot (longer but safer)
