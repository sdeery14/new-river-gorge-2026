## Quick Decision Guide

- **Dry + cold + sunny** → [recommended area]
- **Raining now** → [recommended area/sector with shelter]
- **Rain stopped, drying** → [recommended area based on drying time]
- **Short session / low energy** → [closest, easiest access]
- **Hard climbing priority** → [area with best V7-V10+ density]

## Nuttall Sandstone Drying Reference

| Condition | Overhanging | Vertical | Slab |
|-----------|------------|----------|------|
| Light rain → sun + wind | Already dry | 1-3 hrs | 2-4 hrs |
| Heavy rain → sun + wind | Already dry | 3-6 hrs | 4-8 hrs |
| Heavy rain → overcast | Dry (seepage possible) | 6-12 hrs | 12-24 hrs |
| Multi-day soaking | Seepage on breaks | 12-24+ hrs | 24-48+ hrs |

**Community ethic**: Do not climb on wet Nuttall sandstone. The rock is more friable when saturated. This is a rock-preservation concern shared by NRAC and the NRG climbing community.
