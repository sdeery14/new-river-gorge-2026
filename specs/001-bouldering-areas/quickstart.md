2. Open `areas/README.md` on your phone
3. Use the **Area Summary** table to pick an area based on weather + group energy
4. If raining: check the **Quick Decision Guide** for shelter recommendations
5. Tap the area name link to open the full profile
6. In the profile: tap the **Google Maps link** to navigate to parking
